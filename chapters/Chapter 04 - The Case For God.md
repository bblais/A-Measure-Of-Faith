# The case for God

## Some first thoughts

I want to remind you of the structure of the probability of belief.  Ones belief in an explanation should increase with how well that explanation fits the data and how plausible it is before the data, but it should also *decrease* with all of the other ways the data can be explained by other descriptions. 

![](../images/bayes1.png){width=400px}

Arguments fail primarily for a few reasons:

1. lack of imagination in constructing alternative explanations
2. ill-formed hypotheses where initial plausibilities can't be established
3. hypotheses that are too flexible and can fit any kind of data

A specific example that arises due to point (1) is the false-binary construction of the argument.  You can see this when the argument is built to compare $P(A)$ vs $P(\textbf{not } A)$ where $A$ is the model the arguer wants to support.  Framed in this way, many other alternatives that can push the probabilities up and down are hidden in "$\textbf{not } A$." 

Watch for these points of failure as I explore a number of apologetic arguments that have been put forward to support religious concepts.

## Swinburne

In his book "The Existence of God" [@swinburne2004existence], Richard Swinburne puts forward an argument for the existence of God using probability theory.   We are in a good position now to examine this argument in detail and to see where it falls short of making the case.  I summarize his definitions and arguments first, hopefully not leaving anything out that he would consider crucial.  Whenever I analyze a particular case I prefer to "*steelman*"[^steelmandef] the arguments as a matter of good practice.


[^steelmandef]: "The steel man argument (or steelmanning) is the opposite of the straw man argument. The idea is to find the best form of the opponent's argument to test opposing opinions." (Wikipedia, Steelman.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning)

The argument he describes tries to establish
$$
P(G | \text{data})
$$
where the "data" refers to the observations of the universe as we know from science[^notation].  I anticipate his narrow definition of "theism" to refer to the narrow use of "classical theism," so the proposition $G$ will refer to this definition.

[^notation]: To simplify the discussion we change the notation of Swinburne [@swinburne2004existence].  He writes $P(h|e \& k)$ for our $P(G|\text{data})$ 

### Summary of the argument

Swinburne starts with a definition of theism, 

> $G$: "there exists necessarily a person [mind] without a body (i.e. a spirit) who necessarily is eternal, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and the creator of all things" [clarification added]

with the data referring to the various data of natural theology [@swinburne2003resurrection]:

> 1. the existence of a complex physical universe
> 2. the (almost invariable) conformity of material bodies to natural laws 
> 3. those laws together with the initial state of the universe being such as to lead to the evolution of human organisms
> 4. these humans having a mental life (and so souls)
> 5. these humans having great opportunities for helping or hurting each other
> 6.  these humans having experiences in which it seems to them that they are aware of the presence of God.

Swinburne then spends time describing the simplicity of the God hypothesis.

#### Simplicity

Swinburne states that this explanation is *simplest* for a number of reasons,

> I stress the enormous importance of the criterion of simplicity, an importance that is not always appreciated.
> 

>  A scientific explanation, will have to postulate as a starting point of explanation a substance or substances that caused or still cause the universe and its characteristics. To postulate many or extended such substances (an always existing universe; or an extended volume of matter energy from which, uncaused by God, all began) is to postulate more entities than theism. 

> To start with, theism postulates a God who is just one person, not many. To postulate one substance is to make a very simple postulation. He is infinitely powerful, omnipotent. This is a simpler hypothesis than the hypothesis that there is a God who has such-and-such limited power (for example, the power to rearrange matter, but not the power to create it)....But, if God's essence is an eternal essence, then any complete explanation of phenomena in terms of God's agency is also an ultimate explanation. For God's existence at a time is entailed by his existing at all, and does not require to be explained in terms of his previous existence and previous choices. So the simplest kind of God is a factually necessary one, in the sense defined earlier.

So God being one thing (not many), and infinite in various attributes, and actually exists constitutes the simplest sort of explanation to Swinburne.  He then spends some time describing the properties of omnipotence, omniscience, and omni-benevolence which we won't go into detail here - please read his book of the details.

#### Problem of evil

Swinburne recognizes that the existence of evil in the universe makes it less likely that a God would have made it.

> Although much evil is necessary for the attainment of many of these purposes, there is a limit to the amount of evil that God ought to allow humans (and animals) to suffer for the sake of the good that it makes possible. Even so, if he allows us to suffer as much as we do, he would need to provide a compensatory period of afterlife for any who suffer too much and perhaps to become incarnate to share our suffering. To add to the hypothesis of theism that he does these things complicates it, but not very much. In the absence of this extra evil, the probability that God would create a universe such as I have described would be, I claimed, an equal best kind of act, and so there would be a probability of 1/2 that he would do so. But, if we need to complicate theism somewhat in order to account for the amount of evil, we must put the probability that God would bring about our kind of universe a bit lower.

He then settles on  $P(\text{data}|G)= 1/3$. 

#### Balance of probability

At the end of his book, Swinburne outlines the mathematical form of his argument.  
$$
P(G | \text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data}|G)\cdot P(G)}{P(\text{data}|G)\cdot P(G) + P(\text{data}|\sim G)\cdot P(\sim G)}
$$

where $G$ refers to "the classical theism God exists" and $\sim G$ refers to "the classical theism God *does not* exist."  He then breaks down the terms with $\sim G$ into several different hypotheses, which we can label $H_1, H_2, H_3,$ etc...  In the text, he limits this to three hypotheses,
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{data}|\sim G)P(\sim G)= &P(\text{data}|\sim H_1)P(H_1) + \\
&P(\text{data}|\sim H_2)P(H_2) + \\
&P(\text{data}|\sim H_3)P(H_3)
\end{aligned}
$$
where

> - $H_1$: "there are many gods or limited gods"
> - $H_2$: "there is no God or gods but an initial (or everlasting) physical state of the universe, different from the present state but of such a kind as to bring about the present state"
> - $H_3$: "there is no explanation at all (the universe just is and always has been as it is)"

The probabilities for these hypotheses are set quite low, given the following,

> - $H_1$: "hypothesis of theism is a very simple hypothesis indeed, simpler than hypotheses of many or limited gods"
> - $H_2$: "But there is no particular reason why an unextended physical point or any of the other possible starting points of the universe, or an everlasting extended universe, should as such have the power and liability to bring about all the features that I have described. [...] It will only become at all probable that there will be a universe of our kind if we build into the hypotheses an enormous amount of complexity. " 
> - $H_3$: "And that our universe should have all the characteristics described (above all, the overwhelming fact that each particle of matter throughout vast volumes of space should behave in exactly the same way as every other particle codified in 'laws of nature') without there being some explanation of this is beyond belief. While $P(\text{data}|H_3)=1$ (the universe being this way unexplained entails it being this way),$P(H_3)$ is infinitesimally low."

He concludes with

> And so, $P(G | \text{data})$, the posterior probability of theism on the evidence considered so far, will not be less than 1/2.

with the following caveat,

> I stress again that it is impossible to give anything like exact numerical values to the probabilities involved in these calculations. I have attempted to bring out the force of my arguments by giving some arbitrary values that do, I hope, capture within the roughest of ranges the kinds of probabilities involved. But in reality all that my conclusion so far amounts to is that it is something like as probable as not that theism is true, on the evidence so far considered. 

Finally, he adds that the role of religious experience has the effect of taking the modest probability of $P(G|\text{data})\sim 1/2$ and increasing it substantially,

> unless the probability of theism on other evidence is very low, the testimony of many witnesses to experiences apparently of God suffices to make many of those experiences probably veridical. That is, the evidence of religious experience is in that case sufficient to make theism overall probable. 



### Problems with the argument

There are several problems with the argument as described, broken down into a *mistaken understanding simplicity*, a number of *ill-defined concepts*, a *lack of imagination*, and an *arbitrary assignment of values*.  

#### Simplicity

We saw in [an earlier section][#on-simplicity] that *simplicity* is not about the *number* of parts in an explanation but the *flexibility* of those parts.  Saying that one God is simpler than many gods is not correct, unless that God is equivalent to one of the many gods.  Since Swinburne is proposing a God with infinite faculties compared to many gods with limited faculties the comparison is not equivalent.  A God with infinite faculties also has *infinite flexibility* whereas many gods may not, and thus may be simpler than the one.   The proposal of an infinite God to "explain" the universe has the same content as "magic did it" because both are 

1. single things

2. infinite (or undefined) abilities


Since Swinburne's primary arguments against alternative hypotheses hinges on the simplicity of his proposal, this one critique is enough to call it into question.  A good discussion of these matters of simplicity and models of the world as they apply to Newton's Laws and relativity can be found in  [@jefferys1991sharpening].  

#### Ill-defined concepts

We start with one of the alternative hypotheses,

> - $H_2$: "there is no God or gods but an initial (or everlasting) physical state of the universe, different from the present state but of such a kind as to bring about the present state"

I am not sure if $H_2$ is well-defined, but being charitable we can read it as simply vague.  In science we would break $H_2$ into a number of *specific* models of the universe which make *specific* prediction for quantities like the initial entropy of the universe, the mass distribution of the early universe, the speed of the expansion, etc... The models that are most probable use a modest number of parts to explain *in detail* the present and past state of observable universe.   Does the God-hypothesis, $G$, make *any* of these predictions?  No -- it doesn't.  Equivalent to "magic" God-hypothesis is not well-defined enough to make such predictions.

#### Imagination

The biggest problem when dealing with the probabilities of claims arises with a *lack of imagination*.  We are limited in the number of alternatives that we can consider, so if we cannot *logically* determine that there is a limited set to choose from (e.g. even vs odd whole numbers) then we must be honest about the fact that we probably don't have all of the alternatives listed.  This comes up most clearly in Swinburne with his three alternative hypotheses:

> - $H_1$: "there are many gods or limited gods"
> - $H_2$: "there is no God or gods but an initial (or everlasting) physical state of the universe, different from the present state but of such a kind as to bring about the present state"
> - $H_3$: "there is no explanation at all (the universe just is and always has been as it is)"

how about,

- $H_4$: *Stephen Law's Evil-God*  [@law2010evil]
- $H_5$: *Greek Pantheon*, or any number of other mythos, exists.  This is $H_1$ broken up into specifics
- $H_6$: *Multiverse* models (there could be many) 
- $\vdots$
- etc...

One might feel that bringing in the Greek Pantheon, or the Norse pantheon, that we aren't taking these views seriously.   However there are modern believers in the Norse pantheon, and even if there weren't, the only reason we don't take them seriously currently is because there are not many adherents.  It is the case that atheists actually do view the Christian God Yahweh in the same as Zeus, Thor, or Loki.

In short, one can come up with any amount of alternative models which explain the base-level data that Swinburne wants to handle.  These data don't include specific observations like the expansion rate of the universe, or the fraction of hydrogen and helium in the universe, or the balance between matter and anti-matter, or really anything specific so the number of compatible models is enormous.  The only limit is our imagination.



Once we decide that specific observations are important then it is up to the investigator to propose methods for testing their model (or models) directly agains those observations.  This is true for the theist and atheist alike.

## The Kalam cosmological argument

### Summary of the argument

One of the most popular arguments for God is what is called the Kalam Cosmological Argument popularized by William Lane Craig [@swinburne1979kalam].  The argument, presented in numerous debates and articles, is the following (more detail [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument)),

>1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause
>2. The universe began to exist therefore
>3. The universe has a cause.

He then adds that, for the *cause* to be able to cause the universe, [it must be](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/science-theology/the-scientific-kalam-cosmological-argument/) 

> timeless, spaceless, immaterial, and personal

### Problems with the argument

The clearest exposition of the problems with this argument I have found is [from Sean Carroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qKZqPy9T8&feature=youtu.be&t=2305), in his debate with William Lane Craig.  The problems with the argument are both from the argument itself and from the scientific support for its premises.

The first premise assumes that our everyday experience of causation applies in all cases, even well outside our everyday experience.  We know from physics that this isn't true -- our intuitions fail at the very small, the very large, and the very fast at the least.  On the small scale, there are (to our best knowledge) *uncaused* events such as radioactive decay and the production of virtual particles in the vacuum.   To imagine that our notions of causation should apply to entire universes is naive.  

The second premise is often supported by referring to the Big Bang theory, and such theorems as the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem which William Lane Craig interprets as "the universe must have had a beginning" although Carroll corrects him by saying that the theorem implies that the universe *might* have a beginning but that it only requires that the *expansion* had a beginning.   

Finally, even if our universe had a beginning, its cause could be some other natural process.  Perhaps an outcome of multiverse models, at which one would have to back the argument up to support that the multiverse has a beginning.  However, once this is admitted, we have to come to terms with the fact that we have no evidence about the beginning -- or not -- of the multiverse and the entire argument collapses.

## The fine tuning argument

### Summary of the argument

There are a several arguments which go by the name of Fine Tuning but they all stem from the same idea.  The basic idea comes from scientific observations of the sensitivity of certain physical systems to change.  On the largest scale, the observation is that the conditions in the universe for the development of atoms, molecules, and life itself depend critically on certain *arbitrary* physical constants [@craig2018teleological] such as the speed of light, strength of gravity, and the expansion rate of the universe [@rees2008just].  By critically, we have examples like the gravitational constant needs to be the value it currently is by 1 part in $10^{34}$ (1/10000000000000000000000000000000000 or 1 followed by 34 zeros) or stars wouldn't form, and the expansion rate of the universe within 1 part in $10^{55}$ or the universe would not have lasted long enough for life to form or expanded too quickly to allow for planets to form.  

Similar fine-tuning observations have been suggested more locally [@wallace2015god], like the mass of our Moon and the location of the Earth relative to our Sun.  The argument is the same -- if these properties were at all different then life, and thus humans, would not be here.

These observations are coupled to the argument in the following way.  If we observe some property, then its value must be the result of

1. random chance
2. necessity (i.e. a product or the laws of physics) 
3. design

If it is extremely unlikely (i.e. not random chance) and there is no particular reason from physics for it (i.e. not of necessity) then it must be design.



### Problems with the argument

The clearest exposition of the fine tuning argument I have found is [from Sean Carroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qKZqPy9T8&feature=youtu.be&t=2305), especially in his debate with William Lane Craig. 

The problem is that, despite the confident claims of many theists, the physicists are not at all clear how much fine tuning there is or if there is any at all. The way fine tuning is demonstrated starts with noticing that there are some *seemingly arbitrary* constants in our physical laws (e.g. speed of light, expansion rate of the universe, etc...). These constants if *varied independently* lead to conditions where life *as we know it* couldn't form. The emphasis here is to point out the problems with making confident claims about these observations.

1. The constants may be determined by other laws we don't know right now. The original fine tuning evidence from the expansion rate of the universe used *classical gravity equations* because it was an easier calculation to do.  However, when the more difficult but correct calculations were derived from Einstein's equations it was found that the expansion rate *had to be the particular value* and is thus not fine-tuned.  As our understanding increases, it may happen with some of the other claimed fine-tunings.
2. The constants may not be independent, so changing one may necessitate changing another by a specific amount negating the effect
3. We don't understand the conditions *necessary* for life

With these objections, it seems premature to make any strong statements about fine tuning even if you are convinced it is there.
