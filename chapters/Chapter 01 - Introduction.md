# Introduction

> *Life's most important questions are, for the most part, nothing but probability problems.* - Laplace


## Why write a book like this?

I write this book to convey a way of thinking about the world -- one that has a demonstrated history of success.   This way of thinking forms the basis for all of scientific progress and is the foundation of *all* rational thought.  You use it, in one form or another, when you buy a used car or decide to bring an umbrella when you leave the house, when you vote for president or choose to get vaccinated.  From the trivial to the monumental, many of our decisions are governed by -- or should be governed by -- rational thought.  However, people are a collection of inconsistencies and biases combined with the ability to carefully analyze a situation and its consequences.   Humans have developed on this planet to survive and our mental faculties have a number of short-cuts which allow us to very rapidly come to "pretty-good" solutions.  Although these solutions can be quite useful, we can transcend them by the proper and careful application of evidence and probability.

Some of the short-cuts we have developed have been *useful* and some of them may *feel good* to us, but it is my contention that *the truth matters more*.  I write this book for those who agree with this basic premise. I find that the pursuit of truth is the only way to be completely honest with myself and others. 

> *I want to believe as many true things and as few false things as possible.* -- Matt Dillahunty

Where we don't follow the truth, our actions are at best sub-optimal and at worst dangerous.  I have found that the pursuit of the truth is a challenging yet rewarding activity.  One of my goals is to describe a framework you can apply to any situation.  I have found it useful to practice this framework on small, trivial situations first and build up to more consequential ones.  In this way one can strengthen, like a muscle, one's ability to pursue the truth, to see where someone is not being entirely honest with themselves or others, and to more fully understand the consequences of our actions.

## It's not about the math

Although "probability theory" is a mathematical one, the process is not entirely about the math.  Writing the methods of thinking properly can involve equations; it can also involve pictures and diagrams.  While we reason every day without explicitly placing numbers on our beliefs, we do weight certain possibilities as "more likely" than others.  In this way, we have the relationships *between* possibilities in our heads and we re-weight them as we experience the world.  If we use the methods of probability properly, then we will orient ourselves toward the truth.  If, however, we merely follow our intuitions, our emotions, or our history, then we open ourselves up to the biases that we all have.  It is with the disciplined use of probability that we can hope to avoid these biases.

Unlike English, mathematics is unambiguous.   For this reason, it is the language that must, at base, be the appropriate platform for all discussions of this sort.  However, while there can be a clarity achieved through the terseness and concreteness of mathematics, there are some dangers as well.  Mathematics can be *too abstract*, which can make many people disconnect from the discussion and not see the relevance to the real world.  Mathematics can also be *overly formal*, which can hide mistakes of reasoning behind a veneer of objectivity.  For these reasons I plan on developing the ideas in a couple of ways *in parallel*.   For those comfortable with the mathematics, I will present the equations and the analysis.  The math, although appearing cryptic at first, is nothing more than arithmetic and can be understood through specific examples.  For those who are less comfortable with the mathematics, I will also present the ideas wherever possible with pictures and diagrams.  In this way, I hope to make the structure of rational thought to be accessible to as many people as  possible.  

A further benefit to describing the thought process using probability is to provide a unifying vocabulary to facilitate discussions.  This vocabulary helps to describe our cognitive biases and recognize our prejudices.   By casting our thinking in a somewhat more formal way, we have a method for addressing and avoiding these biases and prejudices. 

## Organization

I begin the book with an elementary introduction to probability.  Those familiar with it can skip that coverage.  I then move on to applications of this way of thinking to topics common in religion, specifically the Christian religion with which I was brought up and have had an interest in for many years.  I cover terms including *belief*, *faith*, *miracles*, *evidence*, *proof* and *knowledge* â€” terms we commonly use but are often clouded by the fuzzy use of language.  The use of mathematics  brings a concreteness and lucidity to more verbose and *murky* approaches.  These methods force  the discussion to be both *specific* and *complete*.  


## Who is this for?

Although I intend this book to be technical, I do not want to scare away those who are less mathematical.  In fact, I would consider it a success if someone who is not particularly inclined in the mathematical arts would be able to get a new appreciation for these topics upon reading this book.  Thus I will use pictures and diagrams to augment the quantitative analysis, and I will rely heavily on specific examples at all times.
