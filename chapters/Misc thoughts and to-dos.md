## Lessons



- apply your reasoning about rare or miraculous things to other rare and improbable things - Mormonism, UFO abduction, etc...  does it work there?  if someone used the argument you've used, but for one of these things, would you be convinced?  why or why not?
- consider alternative explanations for everything
- reconsider your prized beliefs from time to time.  were your original reasons valid?  are they still valid?
- don't take claims at their face value -- follow up to the originals
- don't insist that someone accept your definition for a term or label, especially if it is a label the other person is using for themselves.  a theist telling an atheist what atheism means is as bad as an atheist telling a theist what God means.  
- don't get hung up on labels -- ditch them when they are not useful and get in the way of conversation.
- be aware of cognitive fallacies and the steps to avoid them
- the person that you can fool the easiest is yourself
