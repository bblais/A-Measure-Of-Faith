# Conclusions

Throughout this book I have tried to impart a way of thinking on the reader, something that can be applied to any situation.  This way of thinking allows one to spot points where a claim is not supported properly, where someone is using overly formal language to hide an incomplete argument, and to define key concepts like *belief*, *simplicity*, *justification*, and *faith* in a way that is not so slippery.  The primary method for proper thinking comes down to,

> Ones belief in an explanation should increase with how well that explanation fits the data and how plausible it is before the data, but it should also *decrease* with all of the other ways the data can be explained by other descriptions.

We saw how arguments fail primarily for a few reasons:

1. lack of imagination in constructing alternative explanations, including framing arguments in either-or terms
2. ill-formed hypotheses where initial plausibilities can't be established
3. hypotheses that are too flexible and can fit any kind of data







Although most of this book concerns the application of these ideas to topics in *religious* thought, they can be equally applied in areas of *health*, *politics*, and even *relationships*.  In short, the ideas provide a framework to view all of the claims one encounters in life, from buying a car to voting for a representative to deciding what medical procedures to follow.  

It is my hope that, by seeing these methods applied to specific examples in this book, that you will be able to improve your life through improving your approach to evaluating claims of all kinds.
