Swinburne reiterates his argument for simplicity, which we dealt with last chapter.  He spells out the historical evidence he is considering,

> The detailed historical evidence, consisting of a conjunction of three pieces of evidence
>
> 1. the evidence of the life of Jesus 
> 2. the detailed historical evidence relating to the Resurrection
> 3. the evidence that neither the prior nor the posterior requirements for being God Incarnate were satisfied in any prophet in human history in any way comparably with the way in which they were satisfied in Jesus. 

and breaks up his hypotheses into pieces,

> - $h_1$: the hypothesis that God became incarnate in Jesus
> - $h_2$: the hypothesis that Jesus rose from the dead. 





> - 
> - h is
>   theconjunction(h1 &h2).NowattheendofthedaythisbookisinterestedinP(h|e&k)--theprobabilitythatJesus
>   was God Incarnate who rose from the dead (h), on the evidence both of natural theology (k) and of the detailed history
>   of Jesus and of other human prophets (e).

Note - only considering positive evidence, not negative.  imagination - seen by cultures around the world?  what about the things we do see that are unlikely if there is a God?  or things we don't see which would be likely if a God?

I think this is the point - we have *claims* for these.

what about more exposure?  so much of this seems post-hoc, unimaginative, and not testable.

Note - why can't there be evidence for the event (e.g. a body seen after death) without knowing the cause?  same w/ faith healing.



- $t$: theism is true - there is a God (of the traditional kind)

- $k$: background knowledge of natural theology

- $P(t|k)$: probability there is a God (of the traditional kind) given the background knowledge of natural theology.  He suggests (from Chapter 1) a ''modest'' value of

- $$
  P(t|k) = 1/2
  $$

- $c$: the claim God became incarnate at some time

- $P(c|t,k)$: probability that "*God became incarnate at some time*" given that "*there is a God (of the traditional kind)*" and "*the background knowledge of natural theology*"  Again, from (Chapter 2) he suggests a "*modest*" value of

- $$
  P(c|t,k) = 1/2
  $$

- $P(c|k)$: probability that "*some God became incarnate at some time*" given "*the background knowledge of natural theology*".  Mathematically it is related to the other terms as

- $$
  P(c|k)= P(c|t,k) \times P(t|k) = 1/2\times 1/2 = 1/4
  $$

- $e$: historical evidence, broken up into

  - $e_{1}$: evidence of the life of Jesus (Part II)
  - $e_{2}$: evidence of the detailed history of the Resurrection (Part III)
  - $e_{3}$: evidence that Jesus satisfies the requirements for divine incarnation more than other prophets (Chapter 3)

- $f$: *claims* that the evidence of the strength given by $e$ (also broken up into $f_{1}$, $f_{2}$, and $f_{3}$

- $P(c|f,k)$: the probability of the incarnate God, given the evidence.  This is the term that Swinburne is ultimately interested in.  His final result is the following, but we'll see how he gets there as we continue.

- $$
  P(c|f,k) = \frac{100}{103} = 0.97
  $$

- $P(f|c,k)$: the probability that, if God became incarnate, we would have the evidence we have.  Swinburne suggests the ''fairly low'' number of $P(f|c,k) = 1/10$, so 

- $$
  P(f \& c|k) = P(f|c \& k)P(c|k) = \frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{40}
  $$

- $P(f|k)$: the probability, given $k$, that there is a God who becomes incarnate and leaves evidence of kind $f$ plus the probability, given $k$, that either there is no God or he does not become incarnate and you still have $f$.

- $$
  \begin{aligned}
  P(f|k) &=P(f \& c|k) + P(f \& \sim\!\!c|k)\\
  &=P(f|c \& k)P(c|k) + P(f|\sim\!\!c \& k)P(\sim\!\!c|k)
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  since $P(c|k) = \frac{1}{4}$ we get $P(\sim\!\!c|k) = \frac{3}{4}$. 

- $P(f|\sim\!\!c \& k)$: probability that if there is no incarnation (either because there is no God or he does not become incarnate) and yet there is the evidence of natural theology, $f$ still occurs. Say, 

- $$
  P(f|\sim\!\!c \& k) = \frac{1}{1000}
  $$

  which yields
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  P(f|k) &=P(f|c \& k)P(c|k) + P(f|\sim\!\!c \& k)P(\sim\!\!c|k) \\
  &= \frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{1000}\cdot\frac{3}{4}\\
  &=\frac{103}{4000}
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  and
  $$
  P(c|f\&k)=\frac{P(f|c\&k)P(c|k)}{P(f|k)} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{103}{4000}} = \frac{100}{103}
  $$
