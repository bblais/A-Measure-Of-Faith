            <Text>There is not a universal agreement for the translation of numerical probability values to qualitative terms in English (i.e. highly unlikely, somewhat unlikely, etc...).  One rough guide is shown in Table~\ref{table1}.  I will be following this convention throughout the book, but realize that the specific probability distinctions are a bit arbitrary.

            <Title>Rule 1 (Definition rule)</Title>
            <Text>#### Rule 1 (Definition rule):

$P(A)$ is a number between 0 and 1, representing the strength of belief in a statement, $A$.

An example is  $$P(\mbox{you will get struck by lightning sometime in your life}) = 0.0002$$

Although this probability is estimated by the fraction of people being struck by lightning, whenever we write probabilities we are referring to a measure of the strength of one's belief in a proposition.  Thus, this probability means that you believe it to be extremely unlikely that you will be struck by lightning in your life.  This belief, as we will see, is not just a guess but is something arrived at through proper rational processes, or in other words, by adhering strictly to the rules of probability.

In terms of economy of symbols[^shorthand], we will often define a single symbol to represent an entire sentence, or collection of sentences.  For example,

[^shorthand]: Because this is just a shorthand, we find it useful when the formalism gets too abstract to insert whatever statement for the shortcut you want.  Thus, it helps your intuition to put in a specific example with each equation.

&lt;!--
\beqn
H&amp;\equiv&amp;\left\{\parbox{2in}{``you will get struck by lightning sometime in your life''}\right. \\
P(H)&amp;=&amp;0.0002
\eeqn
--&gt;
means that you believe it to be extremely unlikely that you will be struck by lightning in your life.

            <Title>Analogy Game</Title>
            <Text>Imagine we are playing a game with several small decks of cards[^analogy], defined here:

1. $E_1: A\spades, 2\hearts, 3\spades,4\spades$
2. $E_2: A\hearts, 2\hearts, 3\spades, 4\spades$
3. $E_3: A\hearts,2\hearts, 2\hearts,4\spades$
4. $E_4: A\hearts,3\spades, 3\spades, 4\spades$

In the game, someone has handed us one of the decks, but we don't know at all which one it is.  We then draw the top card, observe that it is a $3\spades$, and see if we can reason about which deck is likely to be the one we are holding.  We choose such a small, simple system because it is easy to intuit the answers without the math.  This intuition can provide a scaffold for understanding the mathematics, which can be used in more complex examples where one *doesn’t* have a strong intuition.  It is therefore worth going through at least one example in detail.

[^analogy]: The analogy here is that the universe is set up with a set of rules that we are trying to determine.  Thus, deciding on which deck we are holding is analogous to deciding which universe we are in given my observations of the universe.  In other words, providing an *explanation* of the data is really about determining which of the many possible universes we are in.

To begin, we need to assign the probabilities of the four cases *prior* to the data.  Given total ignorance, we assign equal probabilities to the four cases
\beqn
P(E_1)&amp;=&amp;1/4 \\
P(E_2)&amp;=&amp;1/4 \\
P(E_3)&amp;=&amp;1/4 \\
P(E_4)&amp;=&amp;1/4
\eeqn

The following are our intuitions, with the mathematics in parallel below. Since we drew a $3\spades$, our intuition says that this should rule out $E_3$ altogether.  Further, it says $E_4$ should be more likely than the other remaining two because it contains the observed card, $3\spades$, more than one time - it is easier to get that particular card from the fourth deck than the others.

The mathematics would look like this
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(E_1|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{P(3\spades|E_1)P(E_1)}{P(3\spades)}\begin{array}{c}\ \\\leftarrow\mbox{this term the same in all}\end{array}\\
P(E_2|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{P(3\spades|E_2)P(E_2)}{P(3\spades)}\\
P(E_3|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{P(3\spades|E_3)P(E_3)}{P(3\spades)}\\
P(E_3|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{P(3\spades|E_4)P(E_4)}{P(3\spades)}
\end{eqnarray*}

where we already have

\beqn
P(E_1)=P(E_2)=P(E_3)=P(E_4)=1/3
\eeqn

Further, we have 

\beqn
P(3\spades|E_1) = 1/4
\eeqn
because one card out of 4 in the first deck is the $3\spades$.  Likewise, we have

\beqn
P(3\spades|E_2) &amp;=&amp; 1/4\\
P(3\spades|E_3) &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
P(3\spades|E_4) &amp;=&amp; 2/4 
\eeqn
Finally we have
\beqn
P(3\spades) = 4/16
\eeqn
because there are $``3\spades’’$ cards out of all the 16 in the game.  Plugging these numbers in to the above equations, and performing the arithmetic, we have

\beqn
P(E_1|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{(1/4)\times (1/4)}{(4/16)} = 1/4 \\
P(E_2|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{(1/4)\times (1/4)}{(4/16)} = 1/4 \\
P(E_3|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{(0)\times (1/4)}{(2/12)} = 0 \\
P(E_4|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{(2/4)\times (1/4)}{(4/16)} = 1/2 \\
\eeqn
which perfectly matches our intuition.  Notice further that $P(3\spades|E_1)$ is another way of saying ``how well is the observation of a $3\spades$ explained by the idea that we're holding the first deck?''  The entire process can then be thought of as updating our initial beliefs with the new evidence.  


&gt; *Any process of reasoning, in any field whatsoever, is either consistent with this process of calculation or it is not rational.*

It is for this reason that we explore this process in such detail.

On another front, an alternate way to have calculated the shared bottom term, $P(3\spades)$, is the following
&lt;!--
\beqn
P(3\spades) &amp;=&amp; P(3\spades|E_1)P(E_1) + P(3\spades|E_2)P(E_2)+ \\
&amp;&amp;P(3\spades|E_3)P(E_3)+ P(3\spades|E_4)P(E_4)\\
&amp;=&amp;(1/4)\times (1/4) + (1/4)\times (1/4) + (0)\times (1/3)+ (2/4)\times (1/4) \\
&amp;=&amp; 4/16
\eeqn
--&gt;
Why would one write it in this seemingly long-winded and complex way?  Because it makes it easier to say, in words, what this term is doing.  It is the sum of all of the probabilities for how well each explanation accounts for the data scaled by how likely that explanation was before seeing the data.  In other words, proper rational inference requires that you re-weight the strength of your beliefs in an explanation not just by how well that explanation describes your observations, but also by how intrinsically likely that explanation is before your observations and how well all of the *alternatives* perform on those same observations.  An observation can be very well explained by a particular explanation, but if it can be equivalently explained by other, simpler, explanations, then your belief in that more complex  explanation may in fact *weaken* with the new observation (i.e. it's probability could go down).

means that you can be certain that either you will be struck by lightning in your life or you won't.  This seems rather obvious, and you may be wondering why we even bring it up, but it becomes a source of one of the most common logical fallacies - the either-or fallacy. 

Notice how this occurs.  The following is correct logical inference:
&lt;!--
\beqn
B&amp;\equiv&amp;\left\{\parbox{1.5in}{“a playing card drawn from a deck is black”}\right. \\
P(B)+P({\rm\bf not}\, B)&amp;=&amp;1

--&gt;
means that, if you draw a playing card from a deck, you can be *certain* that it is either black or it is not-black.  This is true no matter what kind of deck of cards you are dealing with.  The following, however, is not correct logical inference:
&lt;!--
\beqn
B&amp;\equiv&amp;\left\{\parbox{1.5in}{``a playing card drawn from a deck is black''}\right. \\
R&amp;\equiv&amp;\left\{\parbox{1.5in}{``a playing card drawn from a deck is red''}\right. \\
P(B)+P(R)&amp;=&amp;1 \leftarrow\mbox{\underline{\em this is incorrect}}
\eeqn
--&gt;
The key point here is that “not-black” is not the same as “red”, except in those cases where you can be certain that there are only those two possibilities.  One has to be on the lookout for hidden possibilities - perhaps one has a *Five Crowns* deck which has green and yellow cards as well.  Failure of imagination can easily lead to accidental either-or logical failures[^christianeitheror].

[^christianeitheror]: An example seen later is an argument by a Christian examining the probability of theism ($T$) being true or atheism ($A$) being true.  The argument hinges on $P(T)+P(A)=1$, and trying to reduce $P(A)$ to win the argument.  However, the proposition “theism is true” masks as many alternatives as “not-black” in the example here.  One could have the Christian God, the Greek pantheon, the Cthulhu mythological structure, etc... and thus the argument does not perform what the Christian thinks it does.

Why the resurrection data can be evidence for theism, and why arguments for resurrection need not presuppose theism – formal demonstrations
FEBRUARY 18, 2012 / CALUM MILLER
It is often assumed, among Christians and non-Christians alike, that one can only make an argument for the resurrection after showing theism to be probably true already. Or, perhaps, that the resurrection evidence cannot support theism, but can only support the resurrection given theism. Here, I aim to show, briefly, the formal underpinnings (in terms of probability theory) of how the evidence for the resurrection might support theism. I will show how this evidence can work in two ways: to support theism, and also to support the resurrection independently of whether theism is considered to be priorly unlikely or not. NOTE: I AM NOT ADVOCATING THESE PROBABILITIES AS TRUE. I AM SIMPLY SHOWING HOW, IF PEOPLE DO COME TO AGREE ON SOME PROBABILITIES, THE RESURRECTION DATA CAN BE EVIDENCE FOR THEISM, AND HOW ARGUMENTS FOR THE RESURRECTION CAN GIVE AN OVERALL HIGH PROBABILITY EVEN WITH A LOW PRIOR PROBABILITY FOR THEISM.

I am not here aiming to show that the resurrection data show theism to be true or that they show the resurrection to have occurred, only how it would do so. So, let us begin with defining some conditional probabilities:

Let T = theism, R = the resurrection of Jesus, and D = the specific historical data pertinent to Jesus’ resurrection (e.g. empty tomb, appearances, etc)

P(T) includes natural theology, and is 0.01 (that is, the prior probability of theism – I think it is higher than this, but this is only a demonstration)

P(~T) = 0.99 (the prior probability of atheism = 1 – P(T))

P(R|T) is around 0.0001 (that is, the probability of Jesus being resurrected on theism – unlikely, but not inconceivably unlikely)

P(R|~T) is 0.00000001 (that is, the probability of Jesus being resurrected on atheism – very unlikely, probably much lower than this)

P(D|R) = 0.75 (that is, the probability of empty tomb, appearances, etc, given Jesus’ resurrection. This is, again, an artificially precise number, but the point is that it is relatively high)

P(D|~R) = 0.00000001 ( that is, the probability of empty tomb, appearances, etc, given that Jesus was not resurrected. Again, artificially precise, but very unlikely)

Let us work out P(D|~T) to begin with, the probability of  the data on atheism. This is equal to sum of the individual probabilities of all the different kinds of ways the data could obtain on atheism – in our case, the probability of the data on R and on ~R.  So, P(D|~T) = P(D|~T &amp; R)•P(R|~T) + P(D|~T &amp; ~R)•P(~R|~T). With our given probabilities, this is equal to 0.75 x 0.00000001 + 0.00000001 x 0.99999999, which in total is roughly 0.0000000175

Now, we can do the same for P(D|T), which will be equal to P(D|T &amp; R)•P(R|T) + P(D|T &amp; ~R)•P(~R|T). Plugging in our probabilities, this will be equal to 0.75 x 0.0001 + 0.00000001 x 0.9999, which in total is roughly 0.00007501

Now, it follows from Bayes’ Theorem that  P(T|D) = [P(T)•P(D|T)] / [P(T)•P(D|T) + P(~T)•P(D|~T)] (see the derivation of Bayes’ Theorem here). Plugging in our additional beginning probabilities, we note that this is equal to (0.01 x 0.00007501) / (0.01 x 0.00007501 + 0.99 x 0.0000000175) = 0.0000007501 / (0.0000007501 + roughly 0.0000000175), all of which is roughly 0.977 And so the probability of theism given the empty tomb, etc, would be 0.977, whereas the prior probability of theism was only 0.01. Thus, the data, through looking at the different ways it might obtain (that is, under R and ~R), supports theism significantly, and this support does not presuppose a high prior probability of theism.

Now, when looking at the probability of the resurrection, we can come up with a prior probability of the resurrection based on the prior probabilities of theism and atheism, and the likelihood of the resurrection on each of those alternatives. Again, we do not need to give theism a high prior probability to conclude posteriorly that the resurrection probably happened. P(R) is equal to P(R|T)•P(T) + P(R|~T)•P(~T), and our values for these yield a prior probability of R equal to 0.0001 x 0.01 + 0.00000001 x 0.99, which is roughly 0.00000101

Our posterior probability P(R|D) will then be equal to [P(R)•P(D|R)] / [P(R)•P(D|R) + P(~R)•P(D|~R)] (again, from Bayes’ Theorem). and plugging in our values gives us (0.00000101 x 0.75) / (0.00000101 x 0.75 + 0.99999899 x 0.00000001) = 0.0000007575 / (0.0000007575 + roughly 0.00000001) = 0.987. Thus, the prior probability of the resurrection and of theism might be very low (0.00000101 and 0.01, respectively), and yet the historical data might well be strong enough to overcome this, allowing us to conclude that the resurrection happened.

This, then, serves as a rejoinder to those philosophers of religion who do not see the argument from miracles as supporting theism at all, or who think that one need to presuppose theism to argue for a miracle. Neither of these are true, and I hope to have shown this decisively through formal use of the probability calculus. As noted at the start, I am not intending to argue that the probabilities given at the start are correct, only that it is in principle very much possible for one to argue to theism from miracle evidence, and that it is also possible to argue for a particular miracle without presupposing theism.

“(the prior probability of atheism = P(T) – 1)”

Surely you mean:

“(the prior probability of atheism = 1 – P(T))”, otherwise you get a negative result.

The problem is this would work for any miracle event because miracles are far more likely given theism. You have to come up with a way to disclude all other possible gods and religions, otherwise all that you have shown is that miracles do indeed occur given theism being not very a-priori likely.

Indeed, one could declare as a “miracle” any currenlty unknown event or process, then claim god did it on this reasoning. Bayes is supposed to be used as a means of gathering more accurate TEST data. You can’t update on historical events. But that doesn’t mean bayes isn’t valid.

Thanks very much, Greg!

Matthew, that is true. My point here wasn’t to argue for the resurrection, however, only to show that one does not need to presuppose theism in order to argue for it, and that it can be an argument for theism in itself. Your concerns would need to be addressed in a future post on a slightly different topic, of course – I will hopefully get to that soon! If you’re interested in those kinds of considerations, you might want to have a look at Swinburne’s “The Resurrection of God Incarnate” or Tim and Lydia McGrew’s “The Argument From Miracles” in the Blackwell Companion to Natural theology.

In case you were wondering the *kind* of thing I’d say in response (optimistic of me, I know!) I think Swinburne, the McGrews and I would all agree that, in most other cases of miracle claims, P(Miracle|T) is not quite as high as P(R|T) and that P(D|~Miracle) is not quire as low as P(D|~R). Thanks for taking the time to comment!

“P(T) includes natural theology, and is 0.01…”

“P(R|T) is around 0.0001…”

Maybe this is missing your point, but perhaps some philosophers of religion “who do not see the argument from miracles as supporting theism at all, or who think that one need to presuppose theism to argue for a miracle” actually object to assigning probabilities to P(T) or P(R|T).

For example, if a philosopher thinks that one needs to presuppose theism to argue for a miracle, perhaps they’re saying in terms of Bayes Theorem that one needs to presuppose “a type of theism to which probability values can be assigned” to argue for a miracle.

Why do you think it’s possible to assign probability values to P(T) and P(R|T)?

Calum Miller
MARCH 3, 2012 AT 7:55 PM
Thanks for your response, Geoffrey. I don’t see why it would be impossible to give theism a prior probability and yet give other explanatory hypotheses prior probabilities. The argument I’m making here doesn’t strictly require us to give theism a prior probability, nor does it require a well-defined probability for P(R|T). The idea is simply to show that it is at least possible in principle for the resurrection to *raise* the probability of theism from its previous (perhaps inscrutable) value. I don’t think P(T) or P(R|T) can be given particularly precise values, particularly the latter. And, of course, people’s value for P(T) will differ enormously depending on whether they are convinced by arguments from natural theology. Though I think P(T) is actually a lot higher than given here, I was mainly aiming simply to show how even a low value for P(T) can be overcome by evidence for the resurrection.

P(R|T) is even harder – William Lane Craig says it is inscrutable, and I think many would agree with him. I have sympathies towards this and would definitely not want to give it a precise value (or even a precise order). But I think we only need to show that it is not negligible, or that it is a fair bit greater than P(R|~T), to show that the argument might at least have some promise, in principle (though, of course, if one gives it a very small value, one will need to argue that P(D|~R) is accordingly exceedingly small for it to have force in practise). One might then give some factors which would ‘boost’ P(R|T) – for example, arguments that Jesus claimed to be God, and predicted his resurrection, arguments that God, if he existed, would likely become incarnate, etc (Swinburne has done a lot on this). One would then not necessarily need to give a particularly high probability to P(R|T) – it may even be as low as something like 10^-5 or whatever, and yet could still potentially be made posteriorly probable by the evidence for the resurrection.

(I haven’t actually worked out the maths of what kind of range particular probabilities would need to be in for this kind of argument to work, but I will hopefully do so at some point in the future!)

Calum Miller
MARCH 3, 2012 AT 7:58 PM
(I should also note that proponents of this kind of argument would almost always themselves be very tentative in assigning probabilities. In my experience, the idea is not to give realistic values for these probabilities, but to deliberately underestimate one’s own case (and so assign probabilities which the sceptic would favour) and see whether one can still come up with a reasonably high posterior probability for the resurrection and theism.)

Geoffrey Charles
MARCH 3, 2012 AT 8:55 PM
It’s my pleasure, kind Sir.

I must admit, I’m no expert in Bayes Theorem, probability, or math in general.

“I don’t see why it would be impossible to give theism a prior probability and yet give other explanatory hypotheses prior probabilities.”

I don’t know that it’s possible because probability is, as far as I know, only of use regarding natural phenomena.

To illustrate, a phenomena could have many possible explanations. The natural explanations can have probabilities assigned or estimated based on our understanding of the natural world. Our understanding of the natural world, however, doesn’t necessarily give us any basis to assign or estimate, even in principle, probabilities to the supernatural explanations.

Where am I going wrong here?

Calum Miller
MARCH 3, 2012 AT 11:16 PM
Well, how would you say the probabilities are assigned in the natural world? We don’t always simply have the frequency data to be able to do so, so I think we really have to look at other factors which are key in determining which, of different theories giving the same empirical predictions, might be more intrinsically probable. It seems to me that science favours those which are simpler, which involves postulating simple entities, few entities, few kinds of entities, few properties, few kinds of properties, and so on. Theism, in my opinion, does reasonably well on these.

I don’t know if it’s enough to say that theism is more probable than not without any evidence at all – I’d be wary of saying it was *that* simple, but remember the prior probability in question here is not simply the intrinsic probability of theism, it is the probability of theism once we have considered all the data of natural theology, including the fine tuning of the universe. Again, what I would suggest here is that some of the evidence is so strong as to overcome even very small prior probabilities (e.g. fine tuning of the universe) – at least, I think, there is enough evidence to say that the probability of theism given natural theology (represented here by P(T) though, of course, it should really say P(T|K) where K = background knowledge including natural theology) is 0.01 – which I think can be in principle overcome by considering the resurrection data (though not necessarily in practice).

Colin Murphy

Just a few points:
1) “…and yet the historical data might well be strong enough to overcome this, allowing us to conclude that the resurrection happened.” is essentially saying that the evidence is “extraordinary enough” to make our claim believable. That is the beauty of Bayes Theorem: it solves the Threshold Problem as to how extraordinary evidence must be in order to be “good enough”. So, in other words, this piece you wrote is actually a refutation of your prior post titled “Do ‘extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence’? The answer is “yes” and Bayes Theorem tells us just how extraordinary the evidence must be.

2) ” I am not intending to argue that the probabilities given at the start are correct, only that it is in principle very much possible for one to argue to theism from miracle evidence, and that it is also possible to argue for a particular miracle without presupposing theism.” This cuts both ways. The skeptic can also argue against theism without presupposing miracles are impossible. In your specific example the debate would center around the probabilities of P(D|R) and P(D|~R) and what really constitutes the makeup of “D” (i.e. do we really have evidence of an empty tomb or resurrection appearances, or do we just have stories of an empty tomb and resurrection appearances, with the hypothesis that those events actually happened being one of many alternative hypotheses, with each claim being subject to its own Bayesian analysis).

So, it seems to me that you have accomplished two things, maybe unintended:

1) You have shown why extraordinary claims (claims with extremely low prior probabilities) require extraordinary evidence is true, and,

2) You have shown how skeptics can argue against miracles without presupposing theism is false.

Calum Miller
MAY 6, 2012 AT 3:39 PM
Yes – I have always held that propositions with an extremely low prior probability need greater confirmation to be probably true. The reason I might not agree with Sagan’s claim, then, is not because I disagree with this Bayesian principle – but rather simply because of the ambiguity of “extraordinary”. If all that is meant by “extraordinary” is “having a low prior probability” or “providing significant probabilistic support”, then I would agree – but even then the word is being used in two completely different ways. So it’s really a question of semantics.

And yes, I agree that one can argue against miracles without presupposing theism to be probably false.

This is a very interesting article. Out of curiosity, in the context of this article, how do you define “the resurrection of Jesus”?

Thanks for commenting, Jeffery – always good to have another Bayesian around! I’ve been meaning to respond to your “20 questions” post for a while, but haven’t got round to it yet. For this article, I suppose I would definite it as something like, “the bodily raising of Jesus from the dead”.

Thank you for writing this, it strikes at the heart of what’s wrong with apologetics. Christians do not need to argue for some generic theism or even creationism, we need to be arguing for the resurrection!
I was an agnostic once…I know what it’s like to be someone who doesn’t know if “God” exists or even if people know what they mean by the word God. But if God came to earth, announced himself, and proved who he was… then none of that matters. God is then who God knows himself to be. The gospel deals with God as a reality, not a theory. We worship the I AM not the “I might be”.

Thanks for your comment, Joshua. I actually think arguments for generic theism can be useful: they do, after all, give arguments for a necessary (though not sufficient) part of the Christian faith. Indeed, even in this article, you’ll see that one of the terms is P(T) which includes natural theology (all the terms should really include conditioning on N as well) – and is therefore affected by arguments in natural theology!

            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Clearly the terms simplicity, belief, knowledge, and proof are related but it is the framework of probability that helps us be specific about their differences.  We can summarize the situation with the following,

* *Simplicity* refers to the flexibility of a model or hypothesis.  The *simpler* one is less flexible.
* *Belief* is measured by probability.  Higher probability is equivalent to stronger belief, and likewise, lower probability is equivalent to weaker belief.
* *Knowledge* is a subset of belief, described more specifically below.
* *Proof* refers specifically to the result of a *deductive* process.  In this process, one starts with some (given) axioms, and can demonstrate *with certainty* (i.e. prove) a number of theorems (i.e direct consequences) from those axioms.  Thus, the word proof should only be used in situations involving *certainty*, or in other words, probabilities of exactly 1 or exactly 0 only.

The following explores these terms in more detail.</Text>

            <Title>Rule 3 (Conjunction rule)</Title>
            <Text>#### Rule 3 (Conjunction rule):

$$\P{$A$ and $B$} = P(B|A)P(A)$$
which is the probability of two statements both being true, A **and** B.  We define a new symbol, $|$, which should be read as ``given.''  When there is information given, we call this probability *conditional* on that information. 

&lt;!--
\beqn
H&amp;\equiv&amp;\left\{\parbox{1.5in}{``you will get struck by lightning sometime in your life''}\right. \\
G&amp;\equiv&amp;\left\{\parbox{1.5in}{``you like to play golf in the rain''}\right. \\
\P{$H$ and $G$} &amp;=&amp; P(H|G)P(G)
\eeqn
--&gt;
means that the chance of you getting struck by lightning in your lifetime  **and** you like to play golf in the rain is related to the probability of you liking to play golf in the rain ($P(G)$) and the probability that you will get struck by lightning in your lifetime given that you like to play golf in the rain ($P(H|G)$).  There are a few points to be made here, which become important in later examples.

1. Notice how concise the description is - the math can summarize the relationship between several concepts with few words or symbols.  
2. $P(H|G)$ is probably higher than $P(H)$.  In other words, the fact that a person likes to play golf in the rain makes it more likely that they will be struck by lightning in their lifetime.
3. Even if we don't have specific numbers, we can still reason about which probabilities are larger or smaller, or which ones are important or not.
4. $P(H \mbox{ and  } G)$ is   *always* less than $P(G)$ - the conjunction of two things is inherently (and mathematically) less probable than the individual components[^Mormonism].

[^Mormonism]: Sam Harris likes to humorously point out that Mormonism is *objectively* less likely than Christianity because Mormonism is Christianity **and** a number of implausible statements.   This, however, is somewhat misleading because Christianity is also predicated on those so-called implausible statements being false.  One has to be careful when constructing the probabilities!

            <Title>Some Dangers</Title>
            <Text>There are some dangers in this approach.  Most notably there is the danger of introducing confusion by hiding incorrect reasoning behind a smoke-screen of mathematics.  For many, even seeing equations is something scary and they see any presentation with mathematics as being more likely to be true.  The thinking goes, “this is technical, the person presenting it must be smart, so it is more likely true.”  However it is just as likely to be the case that the person presenting the math is just smart at hiding poor reasoning, and that can be done with mathematics more easily.

It is my intent in this book to give you the tools to recreate the claims anyone uses, so that you can confirm for yourself whether something is being hidden in the analysis.  It is also my intent to provide a framework to convert vague philosophical language into the concrete language of probabilities, which leads to a much more powerful method of examining the philosophy.</Text>

\paragraph{Notes}\label{notes}

\textbf{Me - I was really looking forward to this episode. What was not
to like? Probability theory, ancient religions, evidence for
Christianity\ldots{}bring it on! Unfortunately, it really wasn't that
impressive.}

Calum - \emph{``There's what's called the confirmation of resurrection,
the explanatory power. And this is basically the idea that there is a
lot of evidence which, if the resurrection happened would be expected
but if the resurrection didn't happen, it would be very improbable. And
if this is true, if there really is that kind of evidence, then it
follows from probability theory that our confidence in the resurrection
should be greatly increased by this evidence. *Concerning the
prior*, more extraordinary or extreme events are more improbable to
begin with, and so you would need more evidence to confirm them. So a
lot of the debate about the resurrection comes down to the prior
probability, whether we think it is actually really improbable and that
no possible evidence could ever make us convinced of it.''}

\textbf{Me - He basically has the distinction between the following as
the basis for all of the ``calculation'':}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{evidence that, if it existed, would be very common if the
  resurrection \emph{did} happen}
\item
  \textbf{evidence that, if it existed, would be very rare if the
  resurrection \emph{didn't} happen}
\item
  \textbf{the prior probability for the resurrection}
\end{enumerate}

**where he admits that *``the debate about the resurrection comes down
to the prior probability*``. Anyone doing probabilistic inference knows
that it should never come down primarily to your choice of priors. The
data needs to rise above the prior, and the prior needs to be an honest
-ideally objective- assessment of the pre-data probability assignments
or, often, the initial state of ignorance. By admitting this, Calum is
essentially saying either that:**

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{the data are not strong enough to constrain a diffuse prior,
  and thus is unconvincing or\ldots{}}
\item
  \textbf{you have to come into the debate with a \emph{sharp} prior
  which admits to a presupposition of the strength of the claim.}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Neither of these stances is convincing in the slightest.}

\textbf{Further, in response to this set up, he ignores the most
important thing in any Bayesian treatment is the set of models that you
are using to compare. You cannot simply test the truth of a single model
in isolation, nor is it generally informative to compare model A true or
false. Instead one wants to set up a list of models, hypotheses,
theories to explain the data and evaluate those multiple models. Instead
of,}

\$latex\\P(\{\textbackslash{}rm
resurrection\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm
data\})\\\$\\and\\\$latex\\P(\textbackslash{}mbox\{not
resurrection\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm data\})\\\$

\textbf{you'd want}

\$latex\\P(\{\textbackslash{}rm
resurrection\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm data\}),
P(\{\textbackslash{}rm hallucination\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm
data\}), P(\{\textbackslash{}rm legend\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm
data\}), P(\{\textbackslash{}rm literary\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm
data\}), P(\{\textbackslash{}rm hoax\}\textbar{}\{\textbackslash{}rm
data\}),\$ etc\ldots{}\\\textbf{where of course each of these models
would have many details beyond the simple label I'm putting in here. By
being explicit with what you're comparing to, it is easier to see where
the different prior probabilities come in. Are you really going to
suggest that someone rising from the dead is on par, prior to the data,
with a legendary construction given how many legendary constructions
we've seen and how many dead rising we've \emph{not} seen?}

\textbf{What is clear is that all of these other models must, a priori,
be more probable than rising from the dead \emph{even if a God exists}.
Just because you believe miracles \emph{could} happen does not mean that
you believe every miracle claim is true, and given the number of clearly
false miracle claims, the prior probability for any miracle claim must
be quite low - even if you believe miracles actually occur.}

\textbf{Another point about the data which Calum never deals with is
that it should include things we \emph{don't} see, not just things we
do. If we expect something to occur with a claim, and we don't see it,
that is in fact evidence against the claim.}

Chris - Most Christians might discount the claim that the miracles
around African religions seem to disappear in the US and UK because of
lack of faith. Or perhaps the miracle stories around Mormonism. What
makes the miracles of Jesus different than these ones? Once you accept
the idea that resurrection claims can exist quite commonly in a group of
religiously charged people, it is no longer quite so hard to understand
the resurrection claims in the Bible.

Calum - The reports of an empty tomb are exactly what you'd expect if
the resurrection actually happened, and would be unlikely in the case of
a non-resurrection event.

\textbf{Me - Dealing with this is actually very simple. He is correct
that \emph{if the resurrection occurred}, then the report of an empty
tomb would very likely be given, and I would add that it would also be
very likely to be reported in the earliest accounts we have of the
resurrection. Is this what we see? No! The empty tomb is not mentioned
in Paul, neither are the physical visitations, both of which you'd
expect to see if the Resurrection actually occurred. Even the
visitations are not mentioned in Mark! So, from a probabilistic point of
view, this is the exact opposite of what we'd expect to see if the
resurrection actually occurred. In fact the descriptions of the
resurrection get more elaborate and more physical the later the text
(Paul has visions, Mark has no visitations but the empty tomb, Matthew
and Luke have visitations, John has the doubting Thomas story,
etc\ldots{}). This is exactly what we'd expect for legendary
development, or a story that has been embellished over time.}

\textbf{The other thing, is it really all that unlikely to have an empty
tomb story with no resurrection? Notice, I'm not saying to have an empty
tomb, but to have an empty tomb \emph{story}. There are several
different routes to get that. One is as a literary device. I believe
Richard Carrier supports this, as a reference to Daniel. Another is a
deliberate counter to
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism}{Docetism}, to gain favor
and win an argument.}

Calum - \emph{``It is not necessarily helpful to have just some kind of
religious context, it must be the right kind of one. So, for example, I
can see very good reasons why God would want to vindicate Jesus'
teaching by resurrecting him because I think Jesus taught a lot of very
good things, I thought he was (obviously as a Christian) I think he was
a very sincere, a very good person. And I can think of a lot of good
reasons why God would choose Jesus to be a prophet and to become
incarnate in him. Whereas I don't see comparably good reasons why God
would want to vindicate Mormon teaching. Obviously a lot of that is
because I don't know a lot about Mormonism but there's still the
asymmetry there.''}

Chris - The positive evidence for Mormonism is a lot better than for
Christianity. We have signed documents by the early followers and
founders attesting to the miracles. The best we can say about Paul's
evidence is that he had a vision. We have a lot of negative evidence for
Mormonism, to be sure, but if we knew more about Christianity perhaps
things would be different.

\textbf{Me - I would add that we have this \emph{pro-Christian} filter
for all of our documents, a filter called the Middle Ages, where
documents supporting Christianity had a much better probability of
surviving (i.e.~copied) than ones critical of Christianity. The only
reason we have the Nag Hammadi texts is that the monks refused to burn
them, as ordered by the Christian orthodoxy at the time, and instead
chose to store them in a cave. Think about that campaign of whitewashing
for hundreds of years! Actually, the fact that we have so little actual
documentary support for Christianity coming from the first century,
despite this huge bias, to me argues against Christianity.}

Chris- How do you know Jesus was sincere or not? Seems like the same
could be said for Joseph Smith.

\subsubsection{Afterward - a bit about
priors}\label{afterward-abitaboutpriors}

(this section is all \textbf{Me -}, so I won't put it in bold.)

I don't really think that when Calum is referring to priors that he
really means that in the same way as \emph{before the data}. It seems to
me, and I believe Swinburne's analysis reflects this, that the prior for
\emph{this} calculation is really the posterior for a \emph{previous}
calculation regarding the existence and properties of God. This is
perfectly legitimate Bayesian procedure, but it makes the argument a
different one. Because of this,
\href{http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23553-the-resurrection-of-god-incarnate/}{Swinburne's
calculation} for the probability of God needs to be addressed before we
can even deal with the priors in this resurrection argument. That will
have to be another post entirely, but at any rate Calum did not do it a
service in this debate, having not really gotten to the meat of it when
he could have.

            <Title>Knowledge</Title>
            <Text>### &lt;$Title&gt;


What is knowledge?  Plato gave the following definition of knowledge:

&gt; Knowledge is justified true belief.[@fine2003plato]

This is an unsatisfying definition because, it seems, in
order to justifiably label anything as *knowledge* with this
definition we'd need to be able to independently determine that the
proposition is true. This presupposes that there is some “outside”
knowledge, which we feel comes too close to assuming a religious
justification at the outset.  We believe there is likely to be a truth to be known, but that we can never truly know what it is for certain - but this is not a problem. It is a red herring to bring up 100% certainty for knowledge, because it is never achievable, and isn't what we practically call knowledge[^knowledgebelief]. We prefer a definition inspired by Stephen J Gould:

[^knowledgebelief]: In this way, knowledge is a subset of belief.

&gt;In science, ‘fact’ can only mean `confirmed to such a degree that it
&gt;would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.’ I suppose that apples
&gt;might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal
&gt;time in physics classrooms.[@gould1981evolution]


Where it says “fact”, read “knowledge”.  Where it says “science”
read “life”.  The fact, or knowledge, that the Sun rises in the east and sets in 
the west is not due to a formal *proof* that this is always true, or will 
continue indefinitely into the future.  It is an admission that the probability is so 
outrageously high, given the evidence of every other sun rise and sun set observed, 
and the further confirmation of models of the solar system, that it would be “perverse to withhold provisional assent”.  We accept the claim as a practical matter, despite not being 100\% certain, because of the overwhelming probabilities.  This we call knowledge.  It is thus never a problem to admit lack of certainty in knowledge, and it can be seen as an obvious diversion if anyone tries to argue in a manner that suggests it's a problem.

Mathematically, we might write[^approxnotation] it as $P(A)&gt;0.9999 \approx 1$.  Notice that we don't need 100% certainty to claim knowledge, and that it is possible for the “knowledge” to be wrong (although, by definition, it is highly unlikely for this to be the case).  

[^approxnotation]: $P(A)\approx 1$ means that the probability of $A$ is *approximately* equal to 1

We can ask the question, how did we come to this knowledge?  The answer is simply, by applying the rules of probability!  According to Bayes' rule, we update our probabilities given the evidence.  This can lead us to approach, but never equal, probability of 1.  We can approach, but never achieve, complete certainty of any claim.  Rationality only insists that we apply the rules of probability systematically.

        <Document ID="66">
            <Title>Swinburne's argument</Title>
            <Text> His argument is summarized here.  He defines a number of propositions, the chapter references are to his book [@swinburne2003resurrection].

* $t$: theism is true - there is a God (of the traditional kind)
* $k$: background knowledge of natural theology
* $P(t|k)$: probability there is a God (of the traditional kind) given the background knowledge of natural theology.  He suggests (from Chapter 1) a ``modest'' value of $P(t|k) = 1/2$.  We’ll return to this later.
* $c$: the claim God became incarnate at some time
* $P(c|t,k)$: probability that ``God became incarnate at some time'' given that ``there is a God (of the traditional kind)'' and ``the background knowledge of natural theology''  Again, from (Chapter 2) he suggests a ``modest'' value of $P(c|t,k) = 1/2$.
* $P(c|k)$: probability that ``some God became incarnate at some time'' given ``the background knowledge of natural theology''.  Mathematically it is related to the other terms as
$$
P(c|k)= P(c|t,k) \times P(t|k) = 1/2\times 1/2 = 1/4
$$
* $e$: historical evidence, broken up into
    * $e_{1}$: evidence of the life of Jesus (Part II)
    * $e_{2}$: evidence of the detailed history of the Resurrection (Part III)
    * $e_{3}$: evidence that Jesus satisfies the requirements for divine incarnation more than other prophets (Chapter 3)
* $f$: claims that the evidence of the strength given by $e$ (also broken up into $f_{1}$, $f_{2}$, and $f_{3}$
* $P(c|f,k)$: the probability of the incarnate God, given the evidence.  This is the term that Swinburne is ultimately interested in.  His final result is
$$
P(c|f,k) = \frac{100}{103} = 0.97
$$
We'll see how he gets there as we continue.
* $P(f|c,k)$: the probability that, if God became incarnate, we would have the evidence we have.  Swinburne suggests the ``fairly low'' number of $P(f|c,k) = 1/10$

Now all we need do is apply the rules of probability from these estimates, and we obtain Swinburnes answer of 97% probability that God became incarnate in Jesus given the evidence,
\beqn
P(c|f,k) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(f|c,k) P(c|k)}{P(f|k)}\\
P(c|f,k) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(f|c,k) P(c|k)}{P(f|c,k) P(c|k) + P(f|\sim(c,k)) P(\sim c|k)}\\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{\frac{1}{10}\times \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{40} + \left(\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{1}{1000}\right)} \\
&amp;=&amp; 0.97
\eeqn

In his book on the existence of God, Swinburne provides a series of pieces of evidence, denoted $e_{n}$, where $P(e_{n}|h,k)&gt;P(e_{n}|k)$ or the evidence is more likely with theism than in just the background.  He does, however, state that added assumptions to $h$ must be added to account for some pieces of evidence of evil that are less likely under, what he calls, ``bare theism''.  

&gt; The fact that the [evidence of] evil required additional hypotheses to be added to the hypothesis of theism to save it from disconfirmation meant that the evil lowered the probability of theism as such (bare theism) from its probability on the evidence taken into account previously. The fact of divine hiddenness did not, however, count against the existence of God.

Swinburne's calculation follows Bayes' rule

\beqn
P(h|e,k) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(e|h,k)P(h|k)}{P(e|h,k)P(h|k)+P(e|\sim h,k)P(\sim h|k)}
\eeqn

&gt; Let us turn now to $h_{2}$. This is the hypothesis that there is no god or gods, but an initial or everlasting physical state of the universe, different from the present state but such as to bring about the present state. But there is no particular reason why an unextended physical point or any of the other possible starting points of the universe, or an everlasting extended universe, should as such have the power and liability to bring about all the features that I have described.

* $e_1$ be “there is a physical universe?”
* second argument, from $e_2$ (which will be the conformity of the universe to temporal order) i.e. subject to temporal order
*  $e_3$, etc.. consciousness, morality

No physical model here, just words.

&gt; Now I suggest that a universe without connections between universals would be simpler than one with connections; and one with simpler patterns of connection would be simpler than one with such complicated patterns of connection that rational beings would not be able to infer the future behavior of objects by means of the simplest extrapolation from their past behavior. Among theories of the universe as a whole (which will thus have equal scope), simplicity is the sole indicator of intrinsic probability. It then follows that, if we give it the weight that I have urged that we should (so that a very simple theory is more probable than a disjunction of many more complex theories), it would be very probable that there would be no connections between universals at all?that the universe would be chaotic....Either way, it is going to be improbable that in a Godless universe there will be simple connections between universals, and so simple laws of nature.

&gt; The arguments of the previous pages have sought to show just this; and indeed that the probability of order of the right kind is very much greater if there is a God, and so that the existence of such order adds greatly to the probability that there is a God.


&gt; If only a very narrow range of laws and initial conditions allow such evolution, then we may say that the universe is “fine-tuned” for this evolution.

&gt;There remains, however, a consensus among physicists that the values of the constants in the laws of standard theory (as opposed to the variables of initial conditions) must lie within very narrow ranges if life is to evolve anywhere in the universe?ranges that include the actual values of the constants and probably a few other small ranges in which the values of several of the constants are different from their actual ones.

&gt; But the considerable a priori weight of simplicity suggests that in a Godless universe it is a priori improbable that any one universe will be tuned so as to yield human bodies. With $e$ as the existence of human bodies, $h$ as theism, and $k$ as the evidence of a universe conforming to natural laws, $P(e|\sim h,k)$ is very low.

&gt; The laws of Relativity Theory and Quantum Theory, integrated perhaps into a *Grand Unified Theory* or *Theory of Everything* by which everything physical might be explained (fully or partially, even if not completely), give not the slightest reason to suppose that some brain state would cause a green sensation or a sensed smell of coffee.

&gt;If, when I tried to move my foot, my hand moved instead, predators would soon overtake me. But this correct explanation of why (given that intentions cause brain events) the brain is connected by nerves to the rest of the body in the way it is does not explain why we have intentions to move our bodies at all and why they cause brain events, which is a quite different problem. I conclude that the existence of the most novel and striking features of animals and above all of humans (their conscious life of feeling, choice, and reason, causing connected to their bodies) seems to lie utterly beyond the range of successful scientific explanation.

How is this possible?  

&gt;I argued in Chapter 6 that there was a significant probability to which I gave the somewhat artificial value of 1/2 that a God would create humanly free agents?that is, beings who could choose how to make important differences to themselves, each other, and the world.


&gt;I have been arguing that, by permitting moral evil and bringing about natural evil, God gives us (and animals) a good that he could not give us in any other morally permissible way.

&gt;Hence evil provides a good C-inductive argument against the existence of God. But it does not provide a very strong one, for the reason that providing life after death for many humans (not merely those who need compensation) and becoming incarnate to share their suffering are the kinds of act that a good God might well do anyway? for they are good acts (and perhaps good acts of different kinds from the other acts of God that we have been discussing, and maybe even acts of best kinds), whether or not required in order for God justifiably to allow the amount of evil that occurs. (See p. 231 for the goodness of an act of the former kind, and pp. 288-90 for additional reasons that God might have for becoming incarnate.) So, with e as the occurrence of the moral and natural evils known to us, h as the hypothesis of theism, and k as the evidence considered in previous chapters, $P(h|e , k) &lt; P(h|k)$, but the former is not less than the latter by very much.

Argument from divine hiddenness

&gt;But, if the good desire is stronger than the bad one and I have a deep awareness of the presence of God (that is, such that God?s existence is not open to question), then the balance of inclination will be to the good and there will be no free choice between good and bad. We will be in the situation of the child in the nursery who knows that mother is looking in at the door, and for whom, in view of the child?s desire for mother’s approval, the temptation to wrongdoing is simply overborne. We need ‘epistemic distance’ from God in order to have a free choice between good and evil.

Miracles

But although God has reason for bringing these things about, he also has reason for not bringing them about or not bringing them about too automatically in response to human needs....The major such reason is that it is good that humans should decide for themselves whether to warn or convert others, that humans should have some responsibility for the (immediate or long-term) spiritual destiny of their fellows. 

&gt;My conclusion to this section is that, in so far as we have historical evidence (normally in the form of testimony) to the occurrence of an event E that is such that, if it occurred, it would probably be a violation of natural laws and that is of a kind that there is some probability that a God would have reason to bring about, that makes it more probable than it would otherwise be that there is a God. For a God would be expected occasionally to bring about such events. Yet, if there is no God, there is no significant probability that such events will occur. Evidence that an event is of this kind is evidence that it is an event ?too odd? for science to explain. Hence, with k as the evidence discussed in previous chapters, and e as evidence of testimony of the above kind, and h the hypothesis of theism, $P(h|e , k) &gt; P(h|k)$. It will depend on the strength of the testimony, by how much $P(h|e , k)$ exceeds $P(h|k)$.

&gt;God may answer the prayers of members of all religions. And many doctrines of one religion are compatible with doctrines of another religion. Christianity incorp- orates most of Judaism, and is certainly happy to recognize the occurrence of its foundation miracles. But there are cases of conflict, and for those cases Hume?s point is correct. It follows that that religion (if any) which has the best authenticated miracles has the best evidence from this source in its support.


&gt;In discussing religious experience philosophers have sometimes made the claim that an experience is evidence for nothing beyond itself, and that therefore religious experience has no evidential value. That remark reflects a philosophical attitude that those philosophers would not adopt when discussing experiences of any other kind. Quite obviously having the experience of it seeming (epistemically) to you that there is a table there (that is, your seeming to see a table) is good evidence for supposing that there is a table there. Having the experience of its seeming (epistemically) to you that I am here giving a lecture (that is, your seeming to hear me give a lecture) is good evidence for supposing that I am here lecturing. So generally, contrary to the original philosophical claim, I suggest that it is a principle of rationality that (in the absence of special considerations), if it seems (epistemically) to a subject that x is present (and has some characteristic), then probably x is present (and has that characteristic); what one seems to perceive is probably so. And similarly I suggest that (in the absence of special considerations) apparent memory is to be trusted. If it seems to a subject that in the past he perceived something or did something, then (in the absence of special considerations) probably he did. How things seem to be (in contingent respects),9 that is how we seem to perceive them, experience them, or remember them are good grounds for a belief about how things are or were. 

&gt;From this it would follow that, in the absence of special considerations, all religious experiences ought to be taken by their subjects as genuine, and hence as substantial grounds for belief in the existence of their apparent object?God, or Mary, or Ultimate Reality, or Poseidon.

            <Title>Proof</Title>
            <Text>### &lt;$Title&gt;

### Proof

Do *proof* and *evidence* mean the same thing?  No, they don't. To summarize, proof refers specifically to the result of a *deductive* process.  In this process, one starts with some (given) axioms, and can demonstrate *with certainty* (i.e. prove) a number of theorems (i.e direct consequences) from those axioms.  Thus, the word proof should only be used in situations involving *certainty*, or in other words, probabilities of exactly 1 or exactly 0 only.

Evidence, however, factors into inference through an *inductive* process, not *deductive*.  Induction is just another name for the application of the rules of probability, so we have been doing that from the beginning of the book.  Deduction is just another name for formal logic, where the probabilities are restricted to values of 0 or 1 only.  As a result, we have the following maxim,


&gt; *Proof* does not exist in science, only in math and philosophy.

The only place you can have proof is where you have *axioms*
(i.e. unprovable assertions), and can then *prove* a number of
consequences of those axioms. We can prove, for example, that the sum of
the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, if we start with the Euclidean
axioms of geometry. Science doesn't have axioms, and thus there are no
proofs - there is only evidence. We sometimes hear the term “proven
scientifically”, even from people who should know better\footnote{An example of someone who should know better is Richard
Carrier in his [“Is Philosophy Stupid” talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLvWz9GQ3PQ), his [books](http://www.amazon.com/Proving-History-Bayess-Theorem-Historical/dp/1616145595)
and his [articles](http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/theory.html).

Another way of putting it is that probability theory contains deductive logic as a special case.  As it applies to science, it has the following consequence

&gt; All of the evidence in the universe cannot bring the probability of a scientific claim to certainty.

To see this directly, imagine we have two (and only two) hypotheses for
the Earth - flat earth and round earth. We can write Bayes' rule for the
probability of each given the data. Note that this data includes things
like the experience of airplane flight, Magellan's trip, pictures from
space - all of which could be faked! The flat earth hypothesis is not
*logically* impossible, it's just been overwhelmed by the evidence.

\begin{eqnarray*}
P({\rm round}|{\rm data}) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm round})P({\rm round})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm flat})P({\rm flat})+P({\rm data}|{\rm round})P({\rm round})}\\\\
P({\rm flat}|{\rm data}) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm flat})P({\rm flat})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm flat})P({\rm flat})+P({\rm data}|{\rm round})P({\rm round})} 
\end{eqnarray*}

Notice that, no matter how well the round earth hypothesis explains the
data, $$P({\rm data}|{\rm round})\approx 1$$ and how unlikely you
believe it is that the Earth is flat even *before* the data,
$$P({\rm flat})\ll 1$$ as long as there is some *possible* (even if
seriously contrived) way to explain the data with the flat earth
hypothesis, $$P({\rm data}|{\rm flat}) \neq 0$$ it is
*mathematically impossible* to make the round earth hypothesis
certain, $$P({\rm round}|{\rm data})&lt; 1$$

On the right-hand side of Bayes' Rule, the closer the round-earth terms
and the flat-earth terms get to 1 and 0, respectively, the closer the
left-hand terms get to 1 and 0, but they never *equal* 1 and 0.
This does not mean that we can't be *confident* of claims, only
that we cannot have *absolute certainty of anything* in science
(and therefore, in life in general). Anyone who doesn't understand that
does not understand science.

For it to be *reasonable to believe in something*, it must rise to a level of probability that you would label it as *belief*.  Does this ever happen, or should this ever happen, with untrue things?  Certainly.  Here are a few that come to mind.

1. the world is flat - as long as you are constrained to not live near the shore, or see a lunar eclipse
2. life is designed - before the advent of Darwin's theory of natural selection
3. the Sun, and the stars, all go around the Earth - until the advent of physics

In each of these cases there is in fact strong evidence for the claims, and against the counter claims, to make it reasonable to believe them (at the time).  It is no longer reasonable to believe these claims - the process of reason forces one to adjust the probabilities of the hypotheses given new evidence, and to discard those hypotheses that become too improbable.

History, Probability, and Miracles
Posted on March 31, 2013 by Celsus
One of the most common misconceptions about history is the idea that history *is* our past. This misconception is understandable, since when we are taught “history” in high school or even in college the courses provide an overview and summary of different periods in humankind’s past on Earth. The historiographical method, however, which enables us to discover what happened in the past, interpret what it means, and choose how to represent it in a narrative, is often discussed only briefly or not at all. Just as science *is not* the same thing as nature, but the method that we use to investigate nature, history *is not* the same thing as the past, but rather a method that we use in the present to investigate the past.

Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who is considered to be the “father of history,” had been told many stories about past events in the Greek and Persian world. Being the first historian, however, Herodotus wanted to figure out which of these stories were true, which were false, how do we know these stories, and what really happened in these past events. In the opening of his historical work (1.1.0), Herodotus tells his readers that he is performing a ἱστορία (“inquiry”) into human events. His goal was, just as when one investigates nature through scientific observation, to investigate the past by gathering evidence, traveling to different lands, interviewing witnesses, inspecting inscriptions and remains, and ultimately getting to the bottom of what had really taken place.

One of the major differences between history and many of the hypotheses tested in the natural sciences, however, is that the past is not repeatable and cannot be directly observed. You cannot repeat the exact event of Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon in 49 BCE, in the same way that you can repeat an experiment in a laboratory. Instead, historians often have to rely on second-hand reports in ancient texts to know about certain events. This does not mean, however, that history and science should be considered incongruous in their methodology. Good historians do not simply accept whatever is recorded in ancient sources without any consideration for science.

As I explain in my article “History and the Paranormal,” historians assume scientific background knowledge about the natural world when they investigate ancient historical claims. The acceleration rate of gravity on Earth in the 1st century CE was 9.8 m/s/s, regardless of the fact that no ancient source wrote about it. This is not historical knowledge, but scientific knowledge, and historians assume such scientific knowledge regularly when analyzing claims about the past.

Scientific background knowledge is particularly important for evaluating certain types of historical claims — such as the ancient historian Tacitus’ (Ann. 6.28) claim that a phoenix visited Egypt in 34 CE — which involve paranormal phenomena that have not been confirmed by scientific evidence. When historians are confronted with paranormal claims in ancient texts, they do not simply accept such reports at face value in the same way that they accept reports for ordinary events, such as Caesar crossing the Rubicon. The latter example involves no controversial unscientific assumptions (namely, that a human being is capable of crossing a river on a horse), whereas the example of Tacitus’ phoenix does involve controversial unscientific assumptions (namely, that birds like phoenixes even exist and appear in certain places). Historians take into account the lack of scientific evidence for phoenixes when they assess Tacitus’ claim that a particular phoenix visited Egypt in the year 34 CE. This lack of scientific evidence plays a major role in why virtually all Classicists doubt that this event literary happened.

History also has major differences with forensic science, which is a subcategory of science that can more often be used to test unrepeatable events (e.g. the crime scene of a murder). The main difference between ancient history, in particular, and forensic science is the distance from the event being investigated and the types of evidence available. Forensic science is often able to use far more rigorous forms of evidence and testing, such as fingerprints, DNA, materials testing, and so on. Such evidence, however, is typically only available for a limited window of time after the event. When it comes to ancient historical events, from which we are distanced by more than two millennia, such forms of evidence are usually no longer available. There are a few forms of ancient evidence that can still be subjected to (limited) scientific testing — such as archeological evidence with Carbon-14 dating — but the fact is that most events in the ancient world did not leave behind any such physical evidence.

Instead, our knowledge for many historical events in the ancient world relies solely on the reports found in ancient texts. Ancient texts, however, cannot be scrutinized as thoroughly as the evidence studied in forensic science, and thus using ancient texts as a form of evidence for knowing about the past is often far more speculative and less certain (especially when such texts are highly literary or symbolic in their composition). Frequently, the ancient sources that a historian consults will be biased, vague, misinformed, speculative, or simply outright liars (see Bart Ehrman’s Forged: Writing in the Name of God). In short: ancient texts suck as a method for knowing about the past. If we could go back in time and instead test these events through direct observation or forensic science, that method would beat ancient texts in a heartbeat. But sometimes ancient texts are the only evidence that we have for certain historical claims.

As I discuss in my article “When Do Contemporary or Early Sources Matter in Ancient History,” all of our knowledge of the historical Jesus (including the reports of his resurrection) comes down through ancient texts. There is absolutely no archeological evidence at all for Jesus. None of the evidence for Jesus’ resurrection can be tested by the methods of forensic science (though, a similar event could still hypothetically be recorded by forensic science today, despite there being no evidence of such a thing). Furthermore, we have no eyewitness sources for Jesus of any kind (discussed here) and all of the textual sources that discuss his resurrection are not historical in their genre (discussed here). Instead, all we have for investigating Jesus’ resurrection is religious scripture (particularly biased Christian scriptures), which is far from our most reliable kind of evidence. Likewise, as is shown with the example of Tacitus’ phoenix above, historians cannot take paranormal reports in such ancient texts at face value, without consideration of broader scientific background knowledge.

Instead, a method is needed that can situate these claims within our broader background knowledge of the world, in order to determine the likelihood of whether such events could have really taken place within it. 

Bayes’ Theorem

Because history is a method, we need to refine that method if we are to have any hope of ever reaching the truth. When the past can no longer be directly observed, but can only be known through ancient texts, a historian must analyze the evidence available and then construct a hypothesis, based on that evidence, of what probably took place. Different historians looking at the same evidence, however, often form conflicting hypotheses arguing for different versions of what had happened. How do we determine which version is the most likely? How can I argue that my theory about the past is more credible than yours?

Historians have different methods for investigating history, some of which I have discussed before in my blog “Methodological Approaches to Ancient History.” Since history relies on the most probable explanation of the data, however, all historical reasoning that seeks to provide an argument of probability must have a basic introduction to probability theory. Historiographers such as Aviezer Tucker in Our Knowledge of the Past and Richard Carrier in Proving History argue that all of historical reasoning is reducible to Bayesian probability. Thomas Bayes’ theorem is first described by Richard Price in the late 18th century, who wrote to his friend John Canton a letter which explained that Bayes’ goal was “to find a method by which we might judge the probability that an event has to happen, in given circumstances, upon the supposition that we know nothing concerning it but that, under the same circumstances, it has happened a certain number of times, and failed a certain number of times.”

Bayes’ Theorem offers a formula that estimates the probability of a hypothesis about an unobservable event by multiplying the prior probability of the hypothesis by the likelihood of the expected evidence if the hypothesis is true. The hypothesis is further divided by its own probability in addition to the probability of alternative hypotheses, which measures the original hypothesis’ likelihood not in isolation, but in comparison to alternative hypotheses about the event. The last part of this process, which measures the likelihood of alternative hypotheses, is particularly important, since it requires that a hypothesis not only be plausible, but also be the most probable explanation in comparison to alternative explanations.

This is all rather complicated to explain in prose, so I will first provide the formula below, along with Carrier’s simplified explanation of the variables:



P = probability, h = hypothesis, ~h = alternative hypothesis, e = evidence, and b = background knowledge. Here is Carrier’s far more simplified explanation:



Prior Probability = (How typical our explanation is)

Expected Evidence = (How expected the evidence is if our explanation is true)

Why the Prior Probability Is Really Important

Now that a summary of Bayes’ Theorem has been laid out above, allow me to give an example to illustrate how the prior probability can increase or decrease the probability of a particular hypothesis compared to an alternative hypothesis that has equal expected evidence.

Suppose that I am walking across a beach twenty minutes from my home in Southern California and I see hoof prints in the sand. I can tell that some four-footed, hoofed animal ran through, but I cannot tell the exact animal that it was. Suppose then that a friend of mine, who religiously believes in unicorns, argues that these hoof prints are good evidence that a unicorn ran through here and thus unicorns exist. It is true that if a unicorn had ran through that it would have left this kind of evidence, but why am I skeptical of my friend’s claim? The answer is that because the explanation of a unicorn has a much lower prior probability.

Let’s lay out three hypotheses to explain the hoof prints:

H1 = Unicorn

H2 = Zebra

H3 = Horse

The expected evidence of hoof prints in the sand is equal for all three of these hypotheses:

Unicorn (Expected Evidence) = Zebra (Expected Evidence) = Horse (Expected Evidence)

The reason that I can tell that my friend’s explanation is unlikely is because the other two hypotheses have a much higher prior probability in Southern California. When considering the prior probability for these hypotheses the likelihoods are:

Unicorn (Prior Probability) &lt; Zebra (Prior Probability) &lt; Horse (Prior Probability)

In this situation, despite equal expected evidence for each hypothesis, the intrinsic likelihood of a horse being the cause of hoof prints in Southern California drastically increases the probability that a horse had ran through rather than a zebra, and a zebra has a higher probability than a unicorn running through. Even if one does not consciously use Bayes’ Theorem in coming to this conclusion, most of us subconsciously use this intuition when being skeptical of the unicorn hypothesis. Fleshing out how this logic works, however, helps us refine our estimates about an otherwise unobserved event.

Why the Expected Evidence Is Really Important

The example above illustrates that extraordinary claims are less likely than ordinary ones. Does this mean that extraordinary events cannot ever be the most probable hypothesis? Not at all. This is why it is important to also consider the expected evidence when assessing the probabilities of competing hypotheses.

Let’s use another example to illustrate how the expected evidence can support the probability of a hypotheses even when it has a low prior probability.

Suppose that I purchased a ticket in a 1/1,000,000 odds lottery from a state vendor. The lottery only has two options:

H1 = Winner

H2 = Loser

The prior probability that I will win the lottery is vastly lower than the prior probability that I will lose:

Winner (prior probability) &lt; Loser (prior probability)

Suppose then when the winning numbers are announced, the numbers on my ticket match them and I win the lottery. The ticket further contains all of the marks and signs of a valid lottery ticket. I return to the vendor to collect my winnings. The vendor carefully inspects the ticket and finds no signs of tampering or forgery. We have all of the evidence we would expect if I had genuinely won the lottery and none of the evidence we would expect if I lost the lottery:

Winner (expected evidence) &gt; Loser (expected evidence)

The prior probability that I would win is 1/1,000,000, and the prior probability that I would lose is 999,999/1,000,000. But let’s say that the expected evidence that I have a genuine lottery ticket is 999,999,999/1,000,000,000 versus the probability that I had managed to perfectly forge a winning ticket and cheat the system being 1/1,000,000,000. Our Bayes’ formula for the probability of me genuinely winning the would be:



In this example, despite a very low prior probability for winning the lottery, the expected evidence is so strong as to yield a 99.9% chance that I am a genuine winner. Accordingly, a low prior probability does not entail that an unlikely event can never happen. To the contrary, so long as an event with a low prior has strong expected evidence, and the alternative hypotheses have a lower percentage value when you times their prior probability by their expected evidence, unlikely hypotheses can still be the most probable explanation for an event.

The Meaning of Historical Statements

Historians do not always need to assign precise numerical values to the probability of events, as I did above. In fact, most historical judgements will not be so precise. This does not mean, however, that a historian is not using Bayesian logic when assessing the probability of historical claims. Good historians when they argue for the greater probability of a certain historical theory — even if they do not assign precise numerical values — are still evaluating their hypothesis through considerations of its prior probability, expected evidence, and the probability of alternative hypotheses.

When we make historical statements about likelihood, even if we do not spell out their percentage values, we still imply them. The phrases below (roughly) correspond to the different degrees of probability that we are assessing:

“The event almost certainly did not happen” = 1%

“The event very likely did not happen” = 10%

“It is more likely that the event did not happen” = &lt; 50%

“It is uncertain whether the event happened” = 50%

“It is more likely that the event did happen” = &gt; 50%

“The event very likely did happen” = 90%

“The event almost certainly did happen” = 99%

Natural Events That Probably Did Not Happen in the Past

Now that we have laid out the methodology above, I will provide an example of a natural (i.e. non-miraculous) hypothesis advanced by ancient historians that I do not believe is credible.

When I was in the first year of my Classics M.A. program, I wrote a paper about the Roman emperor Tiberius’ execution of his Praetorian prefect Sejanus in the year 31 CE (around the same time as Jesus’ execution). All of the historical sources who write about this event — such as Philo of Alexandria, Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio — agree that Sejanus was leading a conspiracy to usurp Tiberius. Without going into all of the details of this “conspiracy,” here is the basic sequence of events that the historians report: Sejanus had seduced the wife of Tiberius’ son and heir Drusus, he had used Drusus’ wife — Livilla — to poison Drusus (who died in 23 CE, though poison was not suspected at the time of his death), he had convinced Tiberius to retire from Rome so that he could cultivate his own power as Tiberius’ representative in the city (Tiberius retired to the island of Capri in 26 CE), he was controlling all the letter correspondence to Tiberius, he was working schemes to execute Tiberius’ remaining nephews and heirs, and he was either rallying the Praetorian Guard and the Senate to declare him emperor, or was at least working to deceptively convince Tiberius to adopt him as his heir.

Each of these historians provides good evidence for what you would expect if there had been a genuine conspiracy. The conspiracy makes less sense, however, when you analyze the details. First, Sejanus was born an equestrian, not of the senatorial class, and it is very unlikely that the Roman Senate — even if Sejanus had managed either to kill Tiberius or to convince Tiberius to declare him his heir — would have been willing to declare an equestrian emperor. This would be completely unprecedented and unheard of in the historical context of the Roman Empire during the 1st century CE [1]. In short, the prior probability that such a conspiracy could succeed was extremely low. Sejanus was no fool, so it would be odd that he would undergo such a dastardly plan. Furthermore, some of the expected evidence for the conspiracy seems less strong when scrutinized. The accusation that Sejanus had engineered the poisoning of Tiberius’ son Drusus through his wife Livilla, for example, was only made after Sejanus had died, and it was put forth by an enemy of Livilla (Sejanus’ ex-wife Apicata) in order to get her executed. Furthermore, the supposed motive for Livilla in the conspiracy was to be the wife of the new emperor by marrying Sejanus, but she was already married to Tiberius’ son Drusus and in line to become the new empress before the alleged poisoning. The theory of the conspiracy is both intrinsically unlikely and questionable in some of its evidence.

So what happened? As a historian I had to formulate a hypothesis that went against the evidence of all the ancient sources to document this event. This required a certain degree of ad hocness on my part. I postulated that perhaps Drusus had died of natural causes (not uncommon in those days, especially since poison had not been expected at the time Drusus’ death, and there are even a few indications in ancient sources that he had poor health). I also consulted Classicist Robin Seager’s Tiberius, in which he too doubts that Sejanus had been attempting to usurp Tiberius, and instead postulates a theory that, after Drusus’ death, Sejanus was not trying to overthrow Tiberius, but rather working to marry Drusus’ former wife Livilla, in order to become the guardian of her young son Gemellus. Gemellus was Tiberius’ grandson but he was too young to rule on his own, and if Sejanus could convince Tiberius to execute the other family heirs in line before Gemellus (he succeeded in killing two of them), then Gemellus would come to power and Sejanus could rule through him as guardian, in the place of being emperor himself. Unfortunately for Sejanus, however, Tiberius expected foul play and favored the heir in line right in front of Gemellus — Gaius Caligula. Although close to getting Gemellus in power, Sejanus fell short by one heir and was executed.

The theory advanced above is not spelled out by any ancient historian. It further requires that one tweak their interpretations of the data in order to suit an alternative thesis. In this case there is less expected evidence for theory outlined above than the theory of a conspiracy, which has an abundance of ancient evidence. Nevertheless, the prior probability of this theory is stronger than the prior probability of Sejanus leading a conspiracy. Furthermore, some of the expected evidence can be tweaked a little to explain ad hoc assumptions and alternative interpretations of events. Likewise, none of these ad hoc assumptions were of an extraordinary or unscientific character. It is well known that people can try to gain political influence by being appointed the guardians of young royalty, and making such an assumption is nothing like assuming the existence of phoenixes or immortal resurrections. As such, I had a perfectly plausible thesis, and one that I still think is most probable.

In short, in the paper I doubted multiple credible ancient historians about an event. The event had good evidence: multiple attestation, early witnesses, and a detailed explanation of what took place. Nevertheless, I do not believe that this evidence was strong enough to overcome the low prior probability of many of the details, and an alternative hypothesis, even if not attested by any other source to document this period, seems more credible. I am still not completely certain that this theory is correct, but I would assign a low probability to the conspiracy hypothesis (maybe 20% or so), compared to the alternative hypothesis that Sejanus was attempting to become a guardian, as Seager argues. Bear in mind that my ordinary modus operandi in evaluating ancient texts is not to doubt every claim that they report, but in situations where the authors relate inherently implausible, unlikely, or suspicious events, it behooves the modern historian to be more critical and to at least consider alternative explanations. It is fair to say that there are certain types of historical claims that demand more skepticism than others.

If I can doubt multiple credible and independent historians about the likelihood of a natural event, how can I not doubt four anonymous and textually dependent hagiographies like the Gospels in their claims about the supernatural resurrection of Jesus? I underwent all of the steps above in doubting a natural hypothesis that apologists claim skeptics only use in singling out and doubting the miracles of Jesus. If I can doubt a much, much more probable hypothesis like Sejanus’ conspiracy, however, I can certainly doubt a highly extraordinary hypothesis such as Jesus’ immortal resurrection.

Miracles and Probability

First off, something should be said about the meaning of the term “miracle.” The Cambridge Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (pg. 208) defines a “miracle” as follows:

“An event (ultimately) caused by God that cannot be accounted for by the natural powers of natural substances alone. Conceived of this way, miracles don’t violate the laws of nature but rather involve the occurrence of events which cannot be explained by the powers of nature alone. When dead bodies come back to life it is a miracle because the molecules that make up the corpse lack the powers necessary to generate life.”

In other words, miracles involve supernatural intervention from outside of the physical order to effect events that are not causally possible through physical explanations alone. Jesus resurrecting from the dead after three days of brain-death, due to the supernatural intervention of the Judeo-Christian God, is thus a miracle. So far so good.

Sometimes apologists claim that the existence of miracles is purely a “philosophical” question that cannot be tested through science. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Science is a method that is above all empirical. Miracles like resurrections from the dead or turning water into wine would involve demonstrable, empirical change. Scientists could thus test them with scientific methods. Forensic expert Richard Packham discusses the exact sort of evidence that scientists and medical experts could use to prove a miracle in his article “The Man with No Heart: Miracles and Evidence.” It just so happens that there is no evidence — peer reviewed by forensic scientists, medical experts, or parapsychologists — that exists for the occurrence of such miraculous phenomena in modern times. But nevertheless, the existence of miracles is still a scientific question.

If there is no scientific evidence for the existence of miracles, such as Jesus’ resurrection, then this needs to be factored into our background knowledge in the exact same way that the lack of the scientific evidence for phoenixes, discussed above, is factored into our evaluation of Tacitus'(Ann. 6.28) claim that a phoenix had visited Egypt in 34 CE. We do not simply treat the initial probability of all historical claims as equal because of the consideration of prior probability. Events with low priors are less intrinsically likely to occur and, as such, they require greater expected evidence to be rendered more probable. The more extraordinary or unlikely the prior is, the more extraordinary the evidence needs to be.

Often times apologists use false analogies when discussing the probability of miracles with Bayes’ Theorem. William Lane Craig, for example, has argued that winning the lottery may be an extremely unlikely event, but this does not mean that a historian cannot say that someone won the lottery in the past when there is good evidence (like the example I gave above). However, this completely misrepresents the nature of a miracle. Someone winning the lottery is not as unlikely of an event as a miracle. If a million people entered a 1/1,000,000 chance lottery, I would not at all be surprised if one person won it. In fact, if ten million people entered a 1/1,000,000 lottery, and then nobody won, I would be rather surprised. Miracles are not at all like this, however.

We have evidence that lottery wins occasionally occur, but we have no such evidence for miracles. Professional parapsychologists investigate claims about the supernatural all the time, and yet not one has ever passed scientific peer review. There are simply no “bench mark” miracles that we can use as a reference for assessing other miracle claims [2]. Furthermore, there are other extraordinary aspects of Jesus’ resurrection, in particular, that make its occurrence highly unlikely, given our background knowledge of the world we live in. Sometimes apologists appeal to people resuscitating from the dead under extraordinary circumstances (e.g. a person being declared dead for a couple of hours, before resuscitating) as proof that resurrections from the dead are possible. However, this entirely misses the metaphysical character of Jesus’ resurrection. As theologian William Craig (Knowing the Truth about the Resurrection, pg. 15) explains about the nature of Jesus’ resurrection:

“Resurrection is not resuscitation. The mere restoration of life to a corpse is not a resurrection. A person who has resuscitated returns only to this earthly life and will die again.”

Instead, Craig (pg. 127) explains that the actual transformation that is entailed by the Christian claim that Jesus rose from the dead:

“Jesus rose to eternal life in a radically transformed body that can be described as immortal, glorious, powerful, and supernatural. In this new mode of existence, he was not bound by the physical limitations of the universe, but possessed superhuman powers.”

Here, we should immediately think about prior probabilities. Thomas Bayes set out to find a formula “to find a method by which we might judge the probability that an event has to happen, in given circumstances, upon the supposition that we know nothing concerning it but that, under the same circumstances, it has happened a certain number of times, and failed a certain number of times.”

Resuscitations from the dead are known to occur under certain circumstances. Their prior probability is thus not that extraordinarily low. But how many people have immortally resurrected into an imperishable body and never died again? Well, none. As Bayesian expert Robert Cavin (slide 108) explains, the likelihood that Jesus would immortally resurrect, based only on the consideration of how often people immortally resurrect or do not resurrect under the same given circumstance of dying (ignoring other considerations that might further reduce the prior probability of the resurrection), can be computed through a simple statistical syllogism:

99%+ of Xs are Ys
A is an X
Therefore, A is probably a Y
In the case of Jesus’ resurrection, Cavin computes the prior probability using “The Anti-Resurrection Prior Probability Statistical Syllogism”:

99.999…999% of the dead are not supernaturally interfered with by God, and, thus, not raised by Him.
Jesus was dead.
Therefore, it is 99.999…999% probable that Jesus was not supernaturally interfered with by God, and, thus, not raised by Him.
As this syllogism shows, the prior probability for the resurrection of Jesus must be, at the very least, extremely low. So low that alternative explanations, when they are not so intrinsically improbably and can explain the same data, greatly outweigh the probability of the resurrection. I lay out such alternative explanations in my article “Knocking Out the Pillars of the Minimal Facts Apologetic.” Remember, as was discussed above, historians do not analyze individual hypotheses in isolation, but also take into account alternative hypotheses that can explain the same data. When such alternative explanations involve far less intrinsic implausibilities and can still explain the same data, they will always tend to be more probable than extraordinary or paranormal explanations.

Recognizing that the initial likelihood of Jesus’ resurrection is extremely low, apologists often try to argue that the prior probability can be increased, if one takes into consideration the religious context behind the resurrection. For example, apologist William Craig argues:

“That Jesus rose naturally from the dead is fantastically improbable. But I see no reason whatsoever to think that it is improbable that God raised Jesus from the dead.”

But here apologists are assuming far more than is given by the historical evidence. Remember that the evidence is not that God wants to raise Jesus from the dead. As I explain in my article “History and the Divine Sphere,” historians do not have access to God’s will and cannot assume theological premises when engaging in “historical” analysis. As Bayesian expert Robert Cavin (slide 347) explains, things like “religious context” are not bona fide part of the historical evidence. Apologists, for example, often argue that considerations such as Jesus being the “Son of God,” or a fulfillment of biblical prophecies, or having moral perfection, increase the likelihood that God would raise him from the dead. But these are nothing more than religious dogmas, not historical facts. They thus cannot be assumed as sound premises when evaluating the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection, especially when apologists try to use “minimal facts” arguments to try to prove the resurrection. It *is not* a “minimal fact” that God even exists nor that he would want to raise Jesus from the dead. Instead, the only data that the historian needs to explain is why there are *ancient texts* claiming that Jesus rose from the dead.

As historical philosopher Aviezer Tucker (Our Knowledge of the Past, pg. 99) explains, the real question to ask about ancient texts that report miracles is:

“‘What is the best explanation of this set of documents that tells of a miracle of a certain kind?’ The center of research is the explanation of the evidence, not whether or not a literal interpretation of the evidence corresponds with what took place.”

The historian thus only needs to provide a hypothesis for what causes could have produced the ancient texts reporting a miracle. Such causes do not need to entail the actual occurrence of the miracle reported, since reports of miracles can have other causes — such as lies, rumors, misinterpretations of natural phenomena, legendary development, and so on. As I explain in my rebuttal to the minimal facts apologetic, secular historians have identified a number of natural causes that can explain the origins of Christianity and the texts in the New Testament that claim Jesus rose from the dead, without the actual occurrence of a miracle. Likewise, these natural causes do not have the same problems with low prior probabilities. False rumors of resurrections and post-mortem sightings have been known to happen. Actual resurrections have never been confirmed.

Just how low, then, is the prior probability of a miracle like the resurrection of Jesus? Here I argue the such priors are not static. They are being updated all the time by the evidence that scientists, medical experts, and parapsychologists find about the world. If peer reviewed evidence were presented of an immortal resurrection that occurred tomorrow, then the prior probability of Jesus’ resurrection would dramatically increase. The problem is, however, that no such evidence exists. As scientists and other experts continue to accumulate data that shows no signs of such phenomena, their prior probability gradually becomes lower and lower. Moreover, when there are numerous reports of miracles that are later proven to be false under investigation, this data likewise reduces the prior probability of a genuine miracle taking place.

To be fair, the prior probability for any inductive hypothesis can never strictly be 0. However, given infinite time and an infinite number of events, if we continue to take in data that only ever indicates a purely natural world with no miracles, then the prior probability of a miracle will gradually approach 0. Such an asymptotical trend is similar to the following mathematical limit [3]:



This asymptotical trend provides a cumulative case for assigning a low prior probability to miracle claims, as well as other paranormal and extraordinary events. Eventually, enough data is accumulated to render the prior probability of a miracle as statistically insignificant to historical analysis [4]. Now, low priors can be offset by strong expected evidence. But that is the very problem that we have with ancient texts: they will almost never produce extraordinary evidence. Literature that was produced in the ancient world was written in an age before forensics, scientific testing, journalism, internet access, or even common literacy. Ancient literature is thus simply far less reliable than many other forms of evidence that are capable of being produced today.

Something should be said at this point about what is meant by the term “extraordinary.” As forensic expert Richard Packham (“The Man with No Heart: Miracles and Evidence”) explains, the term “extraordinary” does not mean that the type of evidence itself has to be remarkable. Video tapes, x-rays, medical records, and so on are all part of ordinary life experience. What is meant by “extraordinary” in this case is that the evidence in question cannot be equally explained by a wide range of causes, but is only rendered probable under a very specific hypothesis.

Suppose there is a man who has been hit by a vehicle that has broken nearly every bone in his body. He is brought to the hospital, inspected by doctors, and x-rayed. The man dies not long after being brought in. Suppose then that the man is attached to heart and brain monitors for three days showing no activity. Then, on the third day, suppose that the man rises suddenly and walks away from the morgue. The doctors, being amazed, perform another x-ray of the man’s body and find not a single bone broken. The man’s heart and brain are found to be fully functional and healthy. Now, how many alternative hypotheses can explain this kind of data — namely, the doctors’ testimony, x-rays taken before and after the event, heart and brain monitors recording activity throughout multiple days — without the man actually being miraculously cured and raised? Not many. It is not easy to falsify such records, so that the range of alternative explanations that can account for them is quite small. This kind of evidence is thus extraordinary.

The problem with many of the claims in ancient literary texts is that they can be explained by a much wider range of alternative explanations. Suppose that an anonymous author in an ancient text wrote a narrative that cited none of his sources about a man, who lived 40 years in the past in a distant land, having broken nearly every bone in his body, being breathless for three days, and then suddenly rising and walking away perfectly unscathed. Such an event is equally miraculous as the one discussed above. However, the evidence is not extraordinary. All we have is an unknown author writing about the alleged event long after it happened. But we know that authors can write about things for other causes than the event being true. The author may have lied, only reported a rumor, wrote what he had only imagined to be true, been speaking allegorically, and so on. If we know very little about how the evidence in the text was produced (which is the case for the vast majority of ancient texts, including the Gospels), we cannot exclude alternative explanations that are more mundane. It is very easy to falsify such records. They are thus not extraordinary.

Now, we can trust such fallible texts for ordinary claims that do not involve extraordinarily low prior probabilities. When ancient authors wrote about Caesar crossing the Rubicon during a time of war, we know that wars are common events in human history. So, even if an ancient text claiming that a war occurred may have hypothetically been falsely produced, we know that these kinds of events have been confirmed and are not commonly lied about. Their prior probability is much higher and thus can be confirmed with only a moderate amount of expected evidence. No extraordinary evidence is needed for such ordinary claims. But, when it comes to events with extraordinarily low prior probabilities — such as immortal resurrections after multiple days of brain death — historians are justified in exercising greater skepticism, especially when alternative explanations can account for the same data that are less intrinsically improbable.

For example, Tacitus’ (Ann. 6.28) claim of a phoenix visiting Egypt in 34 CE was discussed above. Not only do we have no evidence whatsoever from biologists, zoologists, or ornithologists that phoenixes actually exist, but we also know that reports of such creatures can be caused by purely natural causes — such as lies, rumors, misinterpretations of natural phenomena, legendary development, and so on. In such a circumstance, the probability of Tacitus’ claim being literally correct is so small as to be statistically negligible. It doesn’t even matter that he was an ancient historian (unlike the authors of the Gospels). Ancient historical texts, even when written by the best historians, will virtually never be so extraordinary as to offset the low prior probability of a phoenix actually visiting Egypt. That is why Classicists do not even seriously entertain such a hypothesis, but universally reject it after the briefest consideration. In order to change this assessment, one would need to first give scientific evidence that phoenixes actually exist. Only then would the prior probability of a genuine phoenix appearance in 34 CE be raised to the point of being worth serious historical consideration.

The same exact reasoning can be applied to miracles, such as the resurrection of Jesus. No matter how insistent the report of a miracle in an ancient text may be, and no matter how many ancient sources claim it happened, the extremely low prior probability of such extraordinary occurrences still drags down their overall likelihood to the point of being statistically insignificant, when ancient texts are the only form of expected evidence that we can rely on. At the very least, professional historians usually bracket such miracle claims as being beyond the scope of ordinary historical analysis, both due their intrinsic improbability, and because their underlying theological and metaphysical assumptions are not part of the available historical evidence. Remember that all it took for an author in antiquity to falsely report such claims was merely writing about them in ancient texts. Because such evidence can so easily be falsely produced, it will virtually never be extraordinary enough to offset the low priors of such paranormal claims (especially when there are alternative explanations with higher priors that can explain the same evidence).

In contrast, peer reviewed evidence among scientists, medical experts, and parapsychology cannot so easily be falsely fabricated. These forms of evidence thus have a far greater potential to provide extraordinary evidence and to actually confirm a miracle. And yet these far more reliable methods have never shown that the types of miracles reported in ancient texts ever occur under similar circumstances, when rigorous documentation and investigation is available. Given such cumulative data, virtually any non-miraculous hypothesis that is intrinsically more probable — even if it is less unattested in ancient sources — will still be more probable than a miracle reported in an ancient text actually being genuine. At the very least, the prior probability of a miracle is low enough to render it as too statistically problematic to almost ever be the best explanation in historical analysis, especially when only weak forms of evidence, such as ancient texts, are the only data to consider. 

An apologist might now object that I have “presupposed” naturalism and have axiomatically ruled out any possibility of a miracle happening. This, however, could not be further from the truth. The asymptotical trend, argued above, only states that prior the probability of a miracle will approach 0, if n -&gt; ∞ with no evidence of miracles. All that would be required to change this trend is the confirmed occurrence of just one miracle event. Forensic scientists, medical experts, and parapsychologists have the means to investigate such claims. If peer reviewed evidence for miracles can be offered by such authorities, I will accept it. The burden is on the apologist to provide such evidence. They cannot shortcut the peer review process by simply appealing to a miracle claim in an ancient text, and then claiming that it is a “philosophical” matter that science cannot investigate. Apologists can, in principle, provide the evidence that is need. It just so happens that everyone who has attempted to do so thus far has failed, so that n -&gt; ∞ is still on its current course. But that is simply a matter of where the evidence leads, not apologists being axiomatically ruled out from ever being able to prove such claims.

Miracles That Almost Certainly Did Not Happen in the Past

Rather than singling in on only doubting Jesus’ resurrection, as apologists claim we skeptics do, I will instead compare the evidence for this miracle claim to another supernatural claim about the past that I also do not believe took place. There are countless reports of ancient miracles throughout Pagan literature: Aesculapius healing hundreds of named witnesses (see here), statues moving in front of whole crowds of people (Plutarch’s Coriolanus 38), fish resurrecting from the dead in front of whole towns (Herodotus 9.120). I doubt all of these miracles, and yet I am criticized for doubting the resurrection of one itinerant Jewish prophet from the 1st century CE.

Why do we get these stories? The ancients lived in a world of poor literacy, no cameras, no internet, very little scientific method, no journalism, and extreme superstition. As time has progressed and we have improved in all of these categories, miracle stories have decreased and those that have surfaced have all been discredited when direct examination is possible.

One miracle that I believe has relatively better evidence in antiquity than the resurrection of Jesus (or at least equal evidence) is a miracle that the emperor Vespasian is said to have performed in Alexandria between 69-70 CE. At least three independent historians — Tacitus (Hist. 4.81), Suetonius (Vesp. 7.2), and Cassius Dio (65.8) — record this miracle in which Vespasian, through the aid of the god Serapis, is said to have cured a blind man by spitting in his eyes before a whole crowd of people, in addition to curing a crippled man. Every piece of evidence we have for Vespasian’s miracle can be compared to the resurrection of Jesus.

Date of Earliest Source: Tacitus records Vespasian’s miracle in his Histories (written c. 105 CE), which places his testimony approximately 35 years from the event. The earliest source that we have for Jesus’ resurrection is the apostle Paul, writing about 20-30 years from the event. However, both of these authors had earlier sources. As I have shown in my paper “The Propaganda of Accession of the Roman Emperor Galba,” many of the claims made by the ancient historians who record the Roman civil war of 69 CE (which is the time in which Vespasian’s miracle is recorded to have taken place) have corroborating evidence and independent attestation, which show that the reports they relate must must have dated to much earlier. In fact, since this story is found in both Tacitus and Suetonius, who are likely independent of each other (as discussed by Tristan Power in “Suetonius’ Tacitus”), we can tell that the report about Vespasian’s miracle must have predated both of their works. NT scholar Eric Eve in “Spit in Your Eye: The Blind Man of Bethsaida and the Blind Man of Alexandria” finds evidence for Vespasian’s miracle being alluded to in Mark 8:22-25. Since the Gospel of Mark dates to 70-75 CE in its composition, this could provide very early evidence for the story of Vespasian’s miracle, showing that it was circulating within a year or so of the event’s alleged occurrence. Likewise, the apostle Paul alludes to creeds about the resurrection of Jesus that predate his epistles. In 1 Cor. 15:3-7 Paul relates a creed that discusses the resurrection of Jesus, which most scholars date to 2-5 years after Jesus’ death (I discuss this creed and its relevance further here). Both miracle reports, therefore, probably date to within years of their alleged occurrence.
Fullness of the Account: The problem with these earliest sources is that they do not provide many substantive details for the event. While stories of Vespasian healing the blind were circulating well before Tacitus, he is still our earliest source to provide a substantive account of what allegedly took place. Likewise, the apostle Paul’s testimony does not describe the circumstantial details of Jesus’ resurrection (at least as they are later reported in the Gospels). For example, Paul says nothing about an empty tomb being found by women or Jesus appearing to his disciples in an earthly setting for 40 days, or anything like that. Instead, all Paul relates is that Jesus had died and then ὤφθη (“appeared”) to a number of his followers, without specifying any location, time, or even whether these appearances were physical, as opposed to spiritual revelations. This sparse information, therefore, only tells us that the belief in Jesus’ resurrection dated to the time of the creeds that Paul relates. To get any specific details or substantive narrative of what allegedly took place, we must consult later sources. For Vespasian’s miracle, we have full reports from both Tacitus and Suetonius, respectively 35 and 50 years after the event had allegedly taken place. Cassius Dio also corroborates the event much later in the 3rd century CE. For Jesus’ resurrection, the first substantive narratives that we possess for the event are the canonical Gospels, which date to 40-60 years after its alleged occurrence.
Independent Attestation: Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio are all very different sources (Dio, writing in Greek, even uses a different language than the earlier Latin authors). Tacitus is writing about a historical span of a few decades in his year-by-year annalistic narrative, Suetonius is writing a historical biography of Vespasian’s life, and Dio is writing a universal history of Rome that only small part of which covers Vespasian’s reign. Nevertheless, despite being highly independent, they all corroborate Vespasian’s miracle. In contrast, the Gospels are not independent sources. Matthew copies 80% of Mark’s material, Luke copies about 65% of Mark, and John, although more loosely, probably followed Mark’s basic skeleton or was at least aware of the earlier narratives (as show by Ruprecht in This Tragic Gospel). Accordingly, while we have three independent sources for Vespasian’s miracle, we have highly dependent sources for Jesus’ resurrection via the empty tomb. This is important when assessing the evidence for each event, since independent corroboration is a major criterion that historians consider when assessing probability.
Genre of Writing: Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio are all authors of historical prose. They have lengthy programmatic statements about their historical methodology, they often cite where they obtained their material, their narratives align with what we know about the historical context of the time, and they are writing to a critical and educated audience. In contrast, the authors of the Gospels wrote religious hagiographies intended to serve as theological scripture, they embellish details, they invent completely unrealistic events — such as the Sun going out for three hours and all the saints breaking forth from their tombs and resurrecting along with Jesus — and they ultimate provide legendary, rather than historical accounts. For a further comparison of the genre of the Gospels with the actual historical writing from the same time and period, see my article “Ancient Historical Writing Compared to the Gospels of the New Testament.”
Known Authors: The authorial traditions of Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio are not disputed by any major scholars, and from what we know of these authors’ biographies, they would have had access to a variety of sources and evidence in constructing their histories. In contrast, the dubious authorial traditions of the Gospels are disputed by the large majority of mainstream NT scholars and we have little knowledge of their anonymous authors’ backgrounds and what information may have been available to them. For a further explanation of why scholars doubt the traditional authors of the Gospels, see my article “Why Scholars Doubt the Traditional Authors of the Gospels.”
Directly Observed Miracle vs. Circumstantial Miracle: Notice also how Vespasian performed a miracle in front of an entire audience. Jesus’ resurrection via the empty tomb is not a directly observed miracle but a circumstantial one. Nobody actually saw Jesus rise from the dead; instead, the Gospel legends claim that an empty tomb was found and that Jesus later appeared to people. Because the resurrection itself was not observed, this leaves open other possible explanations for the circumstances, which weakens the case for Jesus’ miracle.
Verification of Condition: In Tacitus’ account of Vespasian’s miracle, physicians are present who verify the condition of the blind and crippled man. In contrast, no physician checks Jesus’ vitals in the Gospels to confirm his death. This leaves open possibilities like the swoon theory (i.e. Jesus only fainted on the cross), which I do not believe are very likely (though still plausible), but this is just another example of how the Gospels’ evidence is weaker than the strength as the physicians’ testimony in Tacitus.
Ultimately, the historical evidence for Vespasian’s miracle is either stronger or at least equal to the evidence for Jesus’ resurrection in every category that has been considered. And yet, I do not believe in Vespasian’s miracle either.

The prior probability that Vespasian miraculously cured the blind and crippled man, as I discussed above, follows an asymptotical trend similar to the mathematical limit lim[n-&gt;∞](1/n) = 0. Until we have evidence of such miraculous curings today (so that n does not approach ∞ with only natural events occurring), alternative natural hypotheses will tend to have a stronger probability, due to their higher prior probability, even if there is worse expected evidence. This is because the evidence for Vespasian’s miracle can all plausibly be explained as the result of natural causes, and the ancient texts that report the miracle are not strong enough to offset its low prior probability.

Perhaps Vespasian staged the event, perhaps the man only falsely said he had been cured of his blindness, perhaps the saliva did temporarily help his eyes, but did not fully cure his blindness. Despite these possibilities, Tacitus (Hist. 4.81) counters all of them by stating: “Both facts [the curing of the blind man and the crippled man] are told by eye-witnesses even now when falsehood brings no reward.” Nevertheless, we must dismiss Tacitus’ claim, despite having no other ancient source who refutes him or the independent authors who corroborate the event. We likewise have no ancient sources that say that Vespasian staged this event. Every piece of ancient evidence that we have says that this miracle was genuine. But at the end of the day, we only have ancient texts, which are not a reliable form of evidence for proving such extraordinary claims. The probability that something natural occurred, especially when there are alternative natural explanations with higher prior probabilities that can explain the same evidence, will always tend to be more probable.

As discussed above, apologists often claim that the prior probability of Jesus’ resurrection is only low if one ignores the religious context. But in the case of Vespasian’s miracle, our historians tell us that he performed the miracle with the aid of the Egyptian god Serapis. Using the same logic, then there is considerable religious context that, by the apologists’ own reasoning, should raise the prior probability of Vespasian’s miracle occurring. Yet I see no better evidence that Serapis exists than that the Abrahamic god Elohim exists. The role of neither is a relevant factor in assessing probability. As discussed above, we cannot consider such theological premises as bona fide part of the historical evidence.

Why Jesus’ Resurrection Almost Certainly Did Not Happen in the Past

I have laid out in this discussion how history is not the same thing as the past, but a method that we use to investigate the past. Lacking the ability to forensically investigate either Vespasian’s or Jesus’ miracles, historian must rely on ancient texts to construct a hypothesis of the most probable explanation of the data. The best explanation of that data, however, must not only take into account the expected evidence of the hypothesis, but also the prior probability. As I have discussed above, absent of any peer reviewed scientific, medical, or parapsychological evidence, we have no “bench mark” miracle to establish that miracles even occur in the world to begin with. As such, the prior probability of a miracle will follow an asymptotical trend similar to the limit lim[n-&gt;∞](1/n) = 0, until such evidence is provided. Lacking such evidence, the prior probability will continue to approach 0 as n -&gt; ∞, when only evidence of a natural world is ever found. In light of this, almost any natural explanation will tend to be more likely than a miraculous one.

In the case of Jesus’ resurrection via the empty tomb, there are numerous natural explanations that can explain the same data without relying on premises with extraordinarily low prior probabilities. I spell of these alternative explanations in my article “Knocking Out the Pillars of the Minimal Facts Apologetic.” When it comes to assessing these different alternative hypotheses, one furthermore does not need to favor any pet theory. Part of using Bayes’ Theorem is recognizing that there can be multiple hypotheses to explain the same set of data. Since there are multiple possible theories, a combination of alternative hypotheses in addition to a particular hypothesis will always be more probable than that individual hypothesis on its own. When you combine multiple natural theories — such as Jesus’ empty tomb being invented, the disciples hallucinating, the body being moved or stolen, the women going to the wrong tomb, the swoon theory, and so on — even if an individual theory may have a low probability on its own (e.g. the swoon theory), the combined probability of multiple theories is much greater. In this way, we do no need to specifically know, for example, that Jesus’ body was stolen, when we can know with greater certainty the more general claim that something other than the resurrection happened in the case of Jesus, whether the body was stolen or something else had occurred. Based on the cumulative evidence against miracles and the analysis above, I would argue that the combined probability of something other than the resurrection of Jesus occurring at Christianity’s origins is well over +99%.

Now, none of this means that one cannot believe in the resurrection on the basis of faith. The story of doubting Thomas in the Gospels makes clear that the resurrection was supposed to be based on faith: “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (John 20:29). I have only written this article because professional apologists — such as William Craig, Gary Habermas, and Mike Licona — claim that they can “historically” prove the resurrection using ancient texts. But this rhetoric is born solely out of the desire to evangelize. A proper understanding of historical methodology, and of how to formulate theories based on the most probable explanation of the data, which includes consideration of our broader scientific knowledge about the world, shows that such miracle claims will virtually never be the most probable explanation of the data. Natural explanations that account for the same evidence are simply far more probable.

I undertake writing these extensive blogs in order to prevent my own discipline of Classics and Greco-Roman history from being hijacked by religious fundamentalists. That I should have to single in on refuting apologetic agendas to “prove” miracles exclusive to only their religion, such as Jesus’ resurrection, while these very apologists ignore the countless Pagan miracles that are likewise confirmed by their same “historical” methodology, shows that such apologists are not really concerned with abstractly proving miracles. They are concerned primarily with proving the miracles exclusive to their religious faith. I, in contrast, doubt both Pagan and Christian miracles, along with many other paranormal claims found in ancient texts, on the exact same logical grounds. Skepticism towards all miracles is consistent, but only seeking to prove miracles exclusive to one’s religious faith, while denying others, is a case of special pleading.

-Matthew Ferguson

[1] The idea of an equestrian becoming Roman emperor was rather unthinkable in the early Roman Empire (27 BCE – 192 CE), during which time every emperor to ascend to power came from senatorial families. In the later Roman Empire, the imperial system became disrupted by civil war which broke down the old senatorial power dynamics, and likewise the equestrians rose in public prominence. It was not until the 3rd century CE that Rome had an equestrian emperor, when Macrinus usurped the emperor Caracalla. Like Sejanus, Macrinus was a Praetorian prefect, but he dated to almost two centuries later and gained power under very different political conditions. A usurpation like Macrinus’ would have been much less plausible in the 1st century CE, not only because Macrinus was Punic (which no Roman emperor had been up until that point), but also because every emperor during the early 1st century CE was related by blood or marriage to the house of Julius Caesar. That Sejanus, therefore, could have pulled off a conspiracy like Macrinus’ during this period is highly unlikely. Instead, adoption was the far more realistic pathway to power, but Sejanus was of too low of rank to have been adopted by Tiberius. As such, this article favors historian Robin Seager’s hypothesis in Tiberius that Sejanus had more realistically been seeking to become the guardian of Tiberius’ grandson Gemellus, in order to rule indirectly through the young prince. There is a 1st century CE precedent for this type of power dynamic, since the philosopher Seneca was appointed to a similar position over the young emperor Nero. However, Sejanus’ original plan was probably embellished by later historians, owing to his infamous downfall and negative reputation, which caused him to be depicted as directly planning to overthrow Tiberius.

[2] Apologists often appeal to Craig Keener’s volume Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts in order to claim that there is modern evidence indicating that miracles actually do occur in the modern world. It is true that Keener has cataloged a large number of miracle claims that still spread throughout multiple regions of the globe; however, even Keener (pg. 1) discusses in the book that he lacks the time and resources to fully investigate the miracles that he records: “With a research grant and a year or two to travel, I could have easily have collected hundreds of further stories … Some circles whose reports I was exploring invited me to witness their experiences first hand; while this deeper investigation would have been ideal, my academic schedule and other factors have precluded my plans to do so.” More importantly, none of Keener’s evidence has passed any peer review by scientists, medical experts, or parapsychologists. If it had, Keener would have no doubt won the Nobel Prize in Medicine by now. Instead, Keener has merely cataloged a bunch of miracle claims without subjecting them to necessary scrutiny. This does not provide any evidence for a “bench mark” confirmed miracle, making Keener irrelevant to the analysis above. Instead, what Keener’s evidence really shows is that a large number of miracle claims still circulate in the world, but that, when they are not disproven, they are simply incapable of being adequately investigated. If they could be adequately investigated, we would have peer reviewed evidence by now (instead of only an apologetics book from Evangelical Christian publisher Baker Publishing Group, written by a NT scholar — rather than a scientist, medical doctor, or parapsychologist — who works at a faith-based seminary with a doctrinal statement affirming the inerrancy of the Bible and the truth of the resurrection). Finally, Keener does not record any miracles that are of a similar character as Jesus’ resurrection. For example, he discusses a number of cases in which people resuscitate under extreme circumstances (pp. 536-579), but, as is discussed above, resuscitations are not at all the same as immortal resurrections. Keener records nothing like people rising into immortal and imperishable bodies, so that even the unconfirmed lesser miracles that he reports are really just a case of comparing apples with oranges. Here is a critical review of Miracles, which raised many good additional points, and I likewise discuss further problems with Keener’s evidence here.

[3] The mathematical limit lim[n-&gt;∞](1/n) = 0 is, of course, technically a different equation than the Bayesian equation, and is not to be understood as a precise calculation of prior probability. Rather, what the limit represents is the asymptotical effect that occurs when repeated evidence and events, given infinite time, continually speak against or provide no instances of a particular kind of phenomenon, such as Sasquatch sighting, psychic predictions, or miracles. As such data is a accumulated, the prior probability of these phenomena actually occurring gradually drops. However, the prior probability can never technically be 0, and hence what occurs instead is an asymptotical trend in which the prior gradually approaches 0, eventually reaching a point where the likelihood of such events actually occurring is statistically insignificant, unless there is extraordinary evidence to offset the extremely low prior. This asymptotical trend is represented, in more simplified form, by the mathematical limit lim[n-&gt;∞](1/n) = 0, but the Bayesian equation follows a similar asymptotical trend as well.

[4] An apologist might object to this approach by arguing that such an asymptotical trend towards 0 for the prior probability of a miracle, based on the cumulative inductive data of no genuine miracles ever occurring and miracle claims being repeatedly falsified, places too much emphasis on modern observation, and does not consider the possibility that a resurrection event, such as Jesus rising from the dead, may only occur once in human history, and thus cannot ever be repeated and reliably documented. Indeed, even as far back as Augustine, many Christians have claimed that the past was an “age of miracles,” which has come and gone, so that a lack of present/future miracles does not falsify God’s past involvement in the world. There are two major problems with this response:

i. To begin with, this kind of rationalization plays easily into the argument from locality. The argument from locality observes that religious experiences, particularly miracles and revelations, tend to be culturally isolated and specific to certain times and regions. This is very odd if there really is one true God, who transcends all time periods and who wishes to make his presence known in the world. Instead, locality suggests that there is no universal force driving religious experience, but rather that human culture is completely relative on the question of religion, which in turn suggests that no one religion is ultimately correct. If God, therefore, only performed miracles like raising Jesus from the dead in a sealed-off time period in the past and only within specific regions (conventionally in times and regions that lacked modern recording and documentation technology), it makes little sense that such a deity would use such isolated evidence to make his presence known in the world. So, even if you perfectly gerrymander the “age of miracles” to have only occurred when Jesus was on Earth, and to have only occurred in front of the first generation of Christians, it is difficult to see what evidence should convince an outsider to raise his or her prior probability of a genuine miracle occurring, given that the only evidence presented is suspiciously so temporarily, regionally, and culturally specific.

ii. But furthermore, even if you gerrymander your hypothesis of miracles, so that miracles only occurred on Earth conveniently during the time of Jesus, to argue that a lack of present/future miracles can in no way falsify the assumption that miracles occurred in the past, this kind of rationalization still drastically lowers the prior probability of a genuine miracle. The reason why has to do with a Bayesian fallacy of gerrymandering one’s hypothesis to perfectly explain consequent probability, without considering the effect of such gerrymandering on prior probability. As Richard Carrier explains in “Two Bayesian Fallacies”:

“Hypotheses can always be gerrymandered so that the probability of the evidence is 1, but that would not mean P(e|h) is always 1, but only that it can always be forced to equal 1 with some elaboration (thus, only with the elaboration can it do so). And even then, such a tactic cannot ignore the mathematical consequences of such gerrymandering to the prior probability. The more you gerrymander a theory to raise its consequent probability, the more you lower that theory’s prior probability, often to no net gain. This is the basic logic of Ockham’s Razor … In essence, you can’t gerrymander P(e|h) to equal 1 without ‘paying for it’ with a reduction in P(h|b). So you would just be moving probabilities around in the equation and not actually getting any better result.”

So, indeed, if one’s pet theory of miracles is that the only miracle that ever has or will occur is Jesus rising from the dead in the 1st century CE and appearing to his followers in the exact way that the Gospels describe, then, indeed, the consequent probability of this hypothesis would be 1, given the evidence in the New Testament. However, as Carrier explains, you cannot get away with this kind of rationalization without “paying for it.” It is extremely ad hoc to assume that such an ultra-specific and conveniently unfalsifiable hypothesis is correct. As such, even if you argue that a lack of present/future miracles in no way lowers the prior probability of a miracle like this occurring in a past “age of miracles,” you still cannot get around the fact that such a gerrymandered theory likewise dramatically lowers the prior probability due to its ad hocness. So, no matter how you slice it, the prior probability of a miracle like Jesus’ resurrection is still extremely low.

Thanks Tito. I wrote this as an expansion upon Hume’s argument against miracles. The proper application of Bayes’ Theorem answers all of the apologists’ objections to Hume, while making his argument more moderate on the skeptical side. Basically, I don’t think that Hume’s objection would always be true (certainly not true if we lived in a world that was actually like the Old Testament), but given the background knowledge of the world we do live in, Hume is spot on about disregarding fantastical miracle claims. Apologists want to argue that a lack of belief in miracles is purely an a priori prejudice, but then I make it quite clear that they could change that skepticism by updating our background knowledge. This is the step, however, that they desperately want to avoid, since they have no evidence to demonstrate that miracles are really more probable than we think.

‘Regardless, one does not even need to favor any pet theory. Any natural explanation, even if it is unlikely on its own, is more likely than a miraculous resurrection.’ Why not just write this? The rest of the article is redundant. All the Bayesian probability is just a cover for what you believe by faith. And I do not buy for a moment your miracle cited is more likely – it was done by a Roman Emperor – can’t you see a certain amount of coersion must be present!

Dear DJ,

“And I do not buy for a moment your miracle cited is more likely – it was done by a Roman Emperor – can’t you see a certain amount of coersion must be present!”

Did you even read Tacitus’ account of this miracle? Here is what Tacitus (a historian who is elsewhere critical of Roman emperors and who is writing after both Vespasian and the Flavian Dynasty) records about Vespasian’s miracle:

“So Vespasian, believing that his good fortune was capable of anything and that nothing was any longer incredible, with a smiling countenance, and amid intense excitement on the part of the bystanders, did as he was asked to do. The hand was instantly restored to use, and the day again shone for the blind man. Both facts are told by eye-witnesses even now when falsehood brings no reward.”

This means that Tacitus was not only aware of eye-witnesses, but also knew of some who still attested to the truth of this miracle, even later when there was no reward or coercion in place. Therefore, we even have an ancient historian who explicitly states that the coercion you claim is behind this miracle report never took place.

I am surprised that you would be so quick to dismiss this miracle and yet scoff when I doubt the miracles attributed to Jesus. No ancient sources say that this miracle of Vespasian *did not* take place. There would have been religious context (a divine power sanctioning a new emperor), and there are multiple historians who record this event.

If you believe that miracles actually occur in the world and that ancient historical texts can be used to confirm them, what grounds do you have for doubting Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio when they independently record this event?

“The rest of the article is redundant. All the Bayesian probability is just a cover for what you believe by faith.”

I, in contrast, have written a lengthy analysis explaining how we have a cumulative inductive case for doubting that any miracles occur in the world, and I have also written elsewhere about the methodological problems involved in trying to use ancient texts to try to prove past miracle claims.

The inductive analysis in this article is based on the cumulative fact that no genuine miracle has ever been confirmed by parapsychologists, medical experts, or forensic scientists, and the fact that virtually all previous miracle reports, when they are capable of being fully investigated by such experts, have been falsified or shown to have a natural explanation when a full investigation is performed. This cumulative information provides us with background knowledge suggesting that ancient miracles were probably falsified or had a natural explanation as well. We can, at the very least, say that such miracle reports are overwhelmingly more likely to be false than genuine. I use this approach to doubt both the miracles of Vespasian and Jesus.

If you have evidence to the contrary, showing that miracles actually do occur in the world, please submit this evidence to a parapsychology, medical, or scientific journal, have it peer reviewed by experts, and then I am sure that you will receive the Nobel Prize.

Short of that, I do not think that we can prove *any* past miracles with good probability using ancient texts. This applies equally to the miracles of Vespasian and Jesus. I am thus methodologically consistent in doubting both of them.

You seek to deny one, while believing in the other, when both are attested among ancient sources (and, IMO, much better sources in the case of Vespasian, since his miracle is recorded by actual historians). I do not, therefore, see a methodologically consistent grounds for you to accept the miracles of Jesus on the basis of ancient texts, and yet to deny the miracles of Vespasian that are also recorded in ancient texts. Lacking such a consistent methodological basis, one is instead engaging in special pleading.

I don’t know what Tacitus means here. Were these men threatened with death unless they recanted like the apostles were? I doubt it. Why would they change their story and be made out as liars? As for the ‘prior probability’ of a miracle claim being made by an emperor, given that they were considered Gods, I would say highly probable. Maybe Vespasian was inspired to do this by another ‘son of God’ who did impressive similar miracles and were making the emperor’s claims to divinity look suspect? If you can’t see the contrived nature of this story and how this is different from the miracles of Jesus – most scholars agree he was at least regarded by his contemporaries as a healer and exorcist – I don’t believe you are thinking it through.

I agree that due the amount of independent attestation this event certainly happened. Was it a miracle? Why would anyone believe that as opposed to my simple hypothesis above?

I don’t know any absolutely watertight cases so I will have to pass on your offer of the Nobel Prize but I do know there is plenty of belief out there. This tells me in most people’s life there is at least some experience of the supernatural. Maybe where there is smoke there is fire? This book deals with this near universal human experience. http://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-Testament-Accounts-Volume/dp/0801039525 . Why a priori dismiss them as you definitely do in your article? It seem intellectually dishonest. You points on Bayesian probability is disingenuous. You use this complex equation but then substitute in 0 into it – and anyone with even a passing understanding of mathematics knows what will happen – it will spit out 0 as an answer. Why not let the evidence speak for its self rather than crafting your own philosophically derived answer?

&lt;&gt;

Most scholars who are experts in the field believe that
1. Jesus existed
2. He was crucified
3. He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea
4. Women found the tomb empty on the morning of the resurrection
5. Many disciples came to believe that they had seen him alive soon afterwards and became so absolutely convinced of this that they were able to convince others even in the face of persecution, torture and death.

If you have a naturalistic hypothesis that explains these five facts (not just one) then you’ve done better that virtually every expert in the field.

DJ,

Literally every question and apologetic talking point that you have responded with I have already thought about, analyzed, and responded to elsewhere in my previous writings.

“I don’t know what Tacitus means here. Were these men threatened with death unless they recanted like the apostles were? I doubt it.”

Tacitus is stating that people still affirmed this miracle, even when there was no reward or coercion motivating them. You tried to immediately dismiss this miracle in your first comment by saying that the witnesses were coerced (despite Tacitus’ explicit statement to the contrary). Rather than admit that you were wrong in this hasty assumption, you have instead tried to change the subject by talking about the apostles’ alleged martrydoms.

Here is an article where I discuss the sources behind the death of every single apostle and show how they are almost all legendary and unreliable:

https://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/48/

I also discuss how Christians, in the actual context of the 1st century CE, would not have been killed for believing in the resurrection (both the Romans and Jews tolerated many diverse views about the afterlife), but on other charges. The Jews persecuted Christians for allegedly teaching a heretical view of the Law (e.g. Stephen). Nero persecuted Christians on charges of arson after the Great Fire of 64 CE. When Christians were (occasionally) persecuted, therefore, historians cannot assume that they died specifically for belief in the resurrection, rather than as the result of other social, religious, and political charges.

“As for the ‘prior probability’ of a miracle claim being made by an emperor, given that they were considered Gods, I would say highly probable. Maybe Vespasian was inspired to do this by another ‘son of God’ who did impressive similar miracles and were making the emperor’s claims to divinity look suspect? If you can’t see the contrived nature of this story and how this is different from the miracles of Jesus – most scholars agree he was at least regarded by his contemporaries as a healer and exorcist – I don’t believe you are thinking it through.”

Scholars also agree that contemporaries regarded Vespasian as a healer. Once more, you are engaging in special pleading. You may actually have it backwards about the stories of Vespasian’s miracles being caused by challanges from another “Son of God.” Here is an article by NT scholar Eric Eve that argues that Jesus’ alleged curing of the blind man of Bethsaida (Mk. 8:22-25) was actually invented and constructed in response to Vespasian’s miracle claim (meaning that Christians were actually the ones worried about impressive, similar miracles being performed by others):

http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1683004&amp;jid=NTS&amp;volumeId=54&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=1683000

As for the prior probability of false miracle claims circulating around Vespasian, because Roman emperors were thought of as gods, I agree! That is why we factor in background knowledge when evaluating these ancient claims and do not just naively accept them at face value.

It is also true that post-mortem sighting of other dead people (e.g. Elvis, Nero, Apollonius of Tyana, Anastasia, and Michael Jackson) virtually always turn out to be false rumors when fully investigated. This background knowledge provides a basis for likewise thinking that Jesus’ post-mortem sightings were probably false and based on rumors.

Likewise, there is a background precedent for other failed Jewish Messiahs being exalted by their followers after their death, who have awaited their second coming. Here is an article that discusses similarities in the early Christians’ belief in Jesus’ resurrection and the cognitive dissonance rationalizations of other failed Messianic movements, such as those of Sabbatai Zevi and Mendel Schneerson:

http://infidels.org/kiosk/article/the-cognitive-dissonance-theory-of-christian-origins-a-cordial-reply-to-dr-william-craig-835.html

“I agree that due the amount of independent attestation this event certainly happened. Was it a miracle? Why would anyone believe that as opposed to my simple hypothesis above? For more on this http://proecclesia.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Evaluating-the-Healing-Miracles-of-Vespasian-and-Jesus-Garet-Robinson.pdf“

You’ve only provided a link to an article (written by a Baptist minister in TX) that you yourself haven’t written. I, in contrast, have analyzed the relevant passages above and evaluated them according to historical criteria drawing from my experience as a PhD student in Classics. You have not responded to any of my arguments but only posted a link. I am not going to do your work for you, and see my Comment Policy about why commenters should not just post links to other sites on this blog without any original contribution of their own. Your tone has also not been particularly respectful so far, with ad hominem jabs like “All the Bayesian probability is just a cover for what you believe by faith.” In all future comments you will desist from such arrogant and condescending remarks, or your comments will not be approved. Consider that a warning.

“I don’t know any absolutely watertight cases so I will have to pass on your offer of the Nobel Prize but I do know there is plenty of belief out there. This tells me in most people’s life there is at least some experience of the supernatural. Maybe where there is smoke there is fire? This book deals with this near universal human experience. http://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-Testament-Accounts-Volume/dp/0801039525 .”

Ah, yes, Craig Keener. I knew he was coming. I said to submit evidence of miracles to a parapsychology, medical, or scientific journal, have it peer reviewed by experts, and then I will accept it. Keener hasn’t done that. His book hasn’t been peer reviewed by any medical or scientific experts. In fact, Keener even says in that book that he doesn’t have the money or resources to investigate the claims that he has compiled. Instead, Keener has only proven that a lot of miracle *claims* still circulate in the world, but he hasn’t proven that any of them are genuine. This actually supports the reasoning in this article that miracle reports virtually always turn out to be either uninvestigable or false when investigated. Since you just posted a link in response to my analysis about Vespasian, here is a link critiquing Keener’s arguments and evidence:

http://www.uncrediblehallq.net/2012/01/05/review-of-craig-keeners-miracles/

Likewise, I just ILL’d a copy of Keener’s two volumes from my university library, and I am planning to write a further critical review of my own sometime in the future (when I get around to it with my graduate work).

“Why a priori dismiss them as you definitely do in your article? It seem intellectually dishonest. You points on Bayesian probability is disingenuous. You use this complex equation but then substitute in 0 into it – and anyone with even a passing understanding of mathematics knows what will happen – it will spit out 0 as an answer. Why not let the evidence speak for its self rather than crafting your own philosophically derived answer?”

This is an intellectually dishonest representation of what I have said. I have specifically said that the prior probability is not 0! Instead, I have set up a *mathematical limit* for how the prior gradually approaches 0 as there is more and more inductive evidence accumulated against a certain sort of phenomena. I have simplified this asymptotical effect through the equation lim[n-&gt;∞](1/n) = 0, but the Bayesian equation produces a similar asymptotical trend as well. The prior would only be 0, if n = ∞, which of course can’t happen. I am, thus, not arguing that the prior is 0, but that it is very low and getting lower as more evidence against miracles is accumulated. This provides justification for a very low prior probability of genuine miracles (which I have reached by letting the evidence of the natural world speak for itself, along with an unprecedented record of no confirmed miracles and the continual disconfirmation of miracle reports, as explained above), without it strictly being 0, even if it will approach 0 as more counter evidence is accumulated.

“Most scholars who are experts in the field believe that
1. Jesus existed
2. He was crucified
3. He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea
4. Women found the tomb empty on the morning of the resurrection
5. Many disciples came to believe that they had seen him alive soon afterwards and became so absolutely convinced of this that they were able to convince others even in the face of persecution, torture and death.

If you have a naturalistic hypothesis that explains these five facts (not just one) then you’ve done better that virtually every expert in the field.”

I have already written a full article explaining how all of the “facts” that you have listed can be explained – top to bottom – in fully natural terms, without the need of magic or miracles:

https://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/

I also discuss in the article how apologists William Craig and Gary Habermas (whom you are simply copying this argument from, without attribution) have misrepresented a lot of the scholarly consensus for some of these “facts.” Likewise, there are plenty of NT scholars who, contrary to your assertions, have fully explained all of these facts far better than apologists. Bart Ehrman just recently in How Jesus Became God has developed a theory that goes all the way from the historical Jesus’ teachings, to his death, to the belief in his resurrection, and to Jesus’ deification as God without the need of magic or a miracle. And there are plenty of other scholars. Even Christian scholar Dale Allison in Resurrecting Jesus acknowledges that there are natural explanations that can account for the origins of Christianity.

Frankly, I find it is rather disingenuous that you have tried to saddle me with questions like this at the end of your comment, without providing any alternative explanation of your own, beyond a god-of-the-gaps assumption. You probably thought that you could catch me off guard and that I had never thought of these issues before, so that I would be stumped by your “5 facts.” When, in reality, I have already written extensively on how they can all be naturally explained. I will also be developing my counter arguments against the “minimal facts” apologetic even further in a book project I am working on that I will be submitting to an academic publisher.

Despite your repeated (ad hominem) assertions that I am not “thinking it through,” I have actually thought about these issues a lot, as someone who studies ancient history at the PhD level, and I find the arguments of apologists like Craig and Habermas to be highly unpersuasive.

Frankly, most apologetic arguments come off as after-the-fact rationalizations targeted towards a lay, built-in audience of already believing Christians. They are not even remotely persuasive to critical outsiders, who are informed on these issues. I know apologists teach you guys to parrot their specious talking points, but the reality is that all of them have been answered by serious scholars who work in real universities, rather than at faith-based Christian universities with doctrinal statements already affirming the truth of Christianity, such as where career apologists like Craig and Habermas work.

I enjoyed this post, but I’m uncertain of how much use it is as an anti-apologetic argument. It seems to me that if I believed in miracles, I’d have to agree with you that they have very low prior probability — if they didn’t, they wouldn’t be miracles. Maybe I’d even agree that the posterior probability is very low. But we could still part ways at the step, “If X has very low posterior probability, then I shouldn’t believe in X”. On the contrary, I might say “the Resurrection has very low posterior probability after weighing all historical evidence, and as a matter of religious faith I believe in it anyway, and even view the smallness of the posterior probability as a positive demonstration of the power of God.” Obviously, deciding not to believe in things with very low posterior probability is a basic part of the scientific mindset, but it’s still a decision, and it seems quite plausible that a religious person could just differ with a skeptic on how to properly arrive at beliefs. This is what “faith” means, as far as I understand it.

Note that this response also allows the religious Christian to, for example, believe in the Resurrection and the miracles of Jesus but not in the Buddhist miracle traditions. They agree that the prior probability is very low in all cases, but have faith in the former rather than the latter.

I don’t think this is the end of the discussion, but it does mean that an argument about probability alone isn’t going to suffice — you have to do the harder work of convincing the person that, for whatever reason, it’s worth it to abandon the religious mindset for the scientific one. (I haven’t really looked at their arguments, but I have to say that it surprises me that William Lane Craig etc. are trying to argue for a high probability of the Resurrection, rather than taking this tack.)

Hi Paul,

I think at the heart of your comment is a differentiation between a faith-based approach to religion, versus an evidence-based approach. Apologetics is primarily concerned with the latter, as is this blog. I really don’t try to argue people out of a faith-based approach, since I am more concerned with protecting academia from religious-based agendas (particularly those derived from schools with doctrinal statements that do not adhere to the freedom of speech in academia).

Apologists like William Craig and Mike Licona argue that Jesus’ resurrection can be proven with high probability. Interacting with scholars like Robert Cavin and Aviezer Tucker, I have made a case for why that is not true, and based on both a very flawed approach to historical evidence, as well as a very flawed approach to calculating the probability of a given individual resurrecting from brain death into an immortal body (along with the other details that are entailed by the resurrection event).

Surprisingly, where I think we actually disagree is that I don’t think that miracles have to be improbable. I do not define miracles as inherently improbable events, but as interventions by God (or by other entities external to the physical world) into the physical world, to perform acts that violate normal patterns of physical cause and effect. Hypothetically, such events could happen all the time. God could part the Red Sea quite frequently, miraculously intervene in multiple wars (in obvious ways) to favor a certain nation, and immediately respond to prayers to perfectly heal amputees. All of the things I described above could also be empirically observed (and even be studied by science).

If such things happened on a common (or even rare, but not “never once”) basis, then their prior probability would not be too low at all, actually. And, indeed, even with a low prior, if Jesus came back to Earth today, and started performing miracles in front of scientists with instruments in the streets of New York, we would still have a good posterior case for a miracle.

So, in principle, the kinds of miracles that Craig and Licona are trying to prove could be quite provable. But a handful of ancient letters and anonymous novelistic biographies–written thousands of years ago, reconstructed from copies of copies, that we are no longer able to corroborate or investigate with any forms of forensic evidence today–are an extremely weak form of evidence. When we place that in a context where there were multiple resurrection narratives in the ancient world, people even today claiming to see dead people still alive, in a world that abounds in hearsay about miracles, Craig and Licona’s case seems quite weak. In such a circumstance, alternative explanations seem to outweigh the probability for the resurrection.

One might have faith in the resurrection, but an evidence-based approach seems to be weak at best, disingenuous at worst, especially when targeted toward a lay audience.

You and Matt Dillahunty should team up and participate in a debate with others. This is one of the best articles I’ve read after reading Richard Carrier’s work on probabilities. I think Matt’s pet peeve is prior probability because in his debate with Blake Giunta he chose to respond(paraphrasing), this is why I don’t like Bayes’ theorem because anyone can increase the prior probability of something and… voilà.

He might have changed his mind on this because he is good at researching but I hoped he gets to read this article. It only makes him better at debunking some claims.

Another great point, as you mentioned, is that many have still not realized that there is no escaping from using the theorem or probabilities. It’s just that people and historians do it implicitly and often without great care, resulting in 1000 different positions on an issue that could be easily solved by assigning probabilities to the h and considering the evidence.

Great work, thank you.

All models are wrong, but some are useful. (George E. P. Box)
Reference: Box &amp; Draper (1987), Empirical model-building and response surfaces, Wiley, p. 424.

Also: G.E.P. Box (1979), "Robustness in the Strategy of Scientific Model Building" in Robustness in Statistics (Launer &amp; Wilkinson eds.), p. 202.

And this is an actual quote, as opposed to something "attributed to" Box. It appears, e.g., in Box &amp; Draper (1987), Empirical model-building and response surfaces, Wiley, on page 424. Yes, I did go and look it up before using it in a paper. – Stephan Kolassa Oct 14 '10 at 15:53

I remember once where a private industry company commissioned a mathematician to solve a garbage collection routing problem. Long story short, the mathematician complained that the company was only interested in finding a "close enough" solution rather than an optimal solution. I think, ultimately he was fired, and an operations researcher was brought in instead. – dassouki Jul 27 '10 at 17:59

"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise." John W. Tukey 1962 The future of data analysis. Annals of Mathematical Statistics 33: 1-67 (see pp.13-14) No doubt he said similar things at other times, but that's a precise source, and the version I usually see quoted. – Nick Cox Apr 27 '13 at 23:02

"To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of."
-- Ronald Fisher (1938)

The quotation can be read on page 17 of the article.

R. A. Fisher. Presidential Address by Professor R. A. Fisher, Sc.D., F.R.S. Sankhyā: The Indian Journal of Statistics (1933-1960), Vol. 4, No. 1 (1938), pp. 14-17. http://www.jstor.org/stable/40383882

I read a slightly different version of this quote by Fisher: "Hiring a physician after the data have been collected is like hiring a physician when the patient is in the morgue. He may be able to tell you what went wrong, but he is unlikely to be able to fix it." – Peter Flom♦ May 27 '11 at 18:10

The following was an attempted edit by an anonymous user: "Comment: It is told after the qoute that I have attributed this (excellent) quote to Hammersley. The reason for my attribution of it to Hammersley was that I asked David Cox before I used the quote, and he answered that it was not originally his, but Hammersley's phrasing.

I'm unsure what this one means. Is that because statistics applies to almost every field? – Ali Turab Lotia Aug 30 '16 at 11:42
  	 	
@Ali, I believe that's the general intent. Statistics can be a very powerful epistemological framework which has found use in multiple fields with extremely complex systems (biology, economics, epidemiology, climate science, etc). – Ashe Sep 16 '16 at 18:17

Good quote, but it's not true! Absence of evidence is not proof of absence, but it certainly is evidence. Why do we think magnetic monopoles (or unicorns, for that matter) don't exist? Because we've looked and haven't found any. – John D. Cook Aug 17 '10 at 18:15

@JohnD.Cook, +1. However, your comment relies on the fact that we have looked, and that there was a reasonable chance of having found evidence if it really were there; consider, for example, the various 'missing links' that were ultimately found (and those that have not yet been). – gung♦ Feb 6 '12 at 18:32
  	 	
Does Sagan qualify as a statistician? – Glen_b♦ Nov 3 '12 at 7:00

@Glen_b It appears that Sagan might have said that in some sense of irony, if it all, being a critic of Martin's quote. That's something to contemplate, for me, since cosmology is so full of examples where predictions have been made to account for inexplicable sources of error that have turned out to be correct (or not quite debunked), e.g. cosmic background radiation, dark matter, and the Big Bang Theory. – AdamO Jan 13 '14 at 17:21

Wrong: 200 C and 0 C average to about 100 C, which is the boiling point of water. Ovens only go down to about 150 C, and 75 C is still too hot. Now, if you have one foot in scalding water (about 55 C) and another in cold icy water... then you are probably a strange person. – alexfernandez Aug 4 '14 at 15:23

Tout le monde y croit cependant, me disait un jour M. Lippmann, car les expérimentateurs s'imaginent que c'est un théorème de mathématiques, et les mathématiciens que c'est un fait expérimental.
Henri Poincaré, Calcul des probabilités (2nd ed., 1912), p. 171.

In English:

Everybody believes in the exponential law of errors [i.e., the Normal distribution]: the experimenters, because they think it can be proved by mathematics; and the mathematicians, because they believe it has been established by observation.
Whittaker, E. T. and Robinson, G. "Normal Frequency Distribution." Ch. 8 in The Calculus of Observations: A Treatise on Numerical Mathematics, 4th ed. New York: Dover, pp. 164-208, 1967. p. 179.

This is a rather free translation of a saying attributed to Gabriel Lippmann by Henri Poincar\'e in his Calcul des probabilit\'es (1896/1912). Original was in French, naturellement. Lippmann won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1908. – Nick Cox Apr 29 '13 at 22:30

All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always different---in some decimal place---for any A and B. Thus asking "are the effects different?" is foolish.

It has actually led to very interesting articles... :) – Tal Galili Jul 31 '10 at 1:07
  	 	
@Tal: Fully agree! I think the whole area on optimal separation in minimax testing is starting from this idea ... and it is still so confused for a lot of statistician. For those interested see the paper of donoho projecteuclid.org/… (and the references in the paper ! since things are much older than donoho's paper) – robin girard Jul 31 '10 at 6:19

My greatest concern was what to call it. I thought of calling it 'information,' but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it 'uncertainty.' When I discussed it with John von Neumann, he had a better idea. Von Neumann told me, 'You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.'

I don't know about famous, but the following is one of my favourites:

Conducting data analysis is like drinking a fine wine. It is important to swirl and sniff the wine, to unpack the complex bouquet and to appreciate the experience. Gulping the wine doesn’t work.

... surely, God loves the .06 nearly as much as the .05. Can there be any doubt that God views the strength of evidence for or against the null as a fairly continuous function of the magnitude of p? (p.1277)

This quote seems to be known only in Germany and there is doubt that it is authentic, see the link below where the State Office of Statistics in Baden-Württemberg show results of their research about this quote (sorry its only available in German). The Times, e.g., said that they never heard about it. statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/… – psj Nov 7 '10 at 10:58

The alternative form is "I only believe in statistics that I doctored myself" sometimes claimed to have been put into Churchill's mouth by Goebbels during a propaganda dispute over wartime losses. – Henry Nov 23 '11 at 22:40
  	 	
I admit that I did not investigate about the quote's origin. However, the core of the statement remains true. Statistics, especially in mass media, are never presented with the necessary information to estimate their validity or correctness. – ymihere Jan 17 '12 at 9:45

The subjectivist (i.e. Bayesian) states his judgements, whereas the objectivist sweeps them under the carpet by calling assumptions knowledge, and he basks in the glorious objectivity of science.

            <Title>Why write a book like this?</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

This book is written to address the role that the mathematics of probability can play when applied to topics in religion.  Specifically, we have found that there are two primary purposes of this approach:

1. Bring clarity to other similar treatments of these topics.  The mathematics of probability have, unfortunately, been used to give the veneer of authority and objectivity to Christian apologetic arguments that are not well supported[@swinburne2003resurrection].  This is typically done by sneaking, possibly inadvertently, a bad assumption into an otherwise correct analysis.  Understanding the structure of the mathematics can help in correcting this.
2. Bring concreteness and lucidity to more verbose and  *murky* approaches.  When talking about terms like *faith*, *miracles*, and *evidence*, the mathematics forces the analysis to be both specific and complete, while at the same time having the benefit of reducing the number of symbols used in the description.  Thus, there is an economy of words that is achieved.  Pages of philosophical exposition can often be summarized by a few equations[@howard2013propositional].  This makes it much easier to explore special cases, and to see where analogies are successful and where they fail.  This process gives the reader the ability to see connections between concepts, even when they seem opposed.

            <Title>Who is this for?</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Although we intend this book to be technical, we do not want to scare away those who are less mathematical.  In fact, we would consider it a success if someone who is not particularly inclined in the mathematical arts would be able to get a new appreciation for these topics upon reading this book.  Therefore, we will try to limit the technical aspects to those that are only absolutely necessary, and will rely heavily on specific examples at all times.

            <Title>Belief, Knowledge, and Scientific Literacy</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Concepts about belief and knowledge arose in the National Science Foundation survey on scientific literacy.  The NSF had decided to change the wording of two questions in the
survey. The original wording is 
\pquote{Human beings, as we know them today,
developed from earlier species of animals,} and \pquote{The universe began
with a huge explosion.}

 The new wording is \pquote{\underline{According to
evolutionary theory,} human beings, as we know them today, developed
from earlier species of animals"  (emphasis mine)} and 
\pquote{\underline{According to astronomers,}
the universe began with a huge explosion." (emphasis mine)}

 It is noted that there will be a transition period with the questions, with half of the surveys containing the new questions and half the old, to determine its effect.

The stated goal for this change, from the NSF, is to separate knowledge
from belief. You might *believe* that humans are created in their
present form, 6000 years ago, but the new questions try to ascertain
whether you know that "evolutionary theory" says something different.
Is this an important distinction? Is this what we really want to
measure? Which is more important for a society? What is the difference
between knowledge and belief in this context?[^It is quite clear that there will be at least one effect for this
rewording: given that the US falls way behind other countries on science
literacy, especially with these particular questions, the rewording will
most likely increase these numbers with no other work done.]

Since beliefs are representations of the world that we hold to be correct for the real world\ldots{}as
opposed to hopes, which are also representations of the world but not
ones that we hold to be necessarily correct. Knowledge is, as we have defined, simply that collection
of beliefs that we hold with such high probability or, in other words,
with such confidence that we do not significantly doubt them. The belief
that the sun rises in the east each morning is considered knowledge for
the reason that we hold it with an extremely high probability. 

The NSF defines scientific literacy as
\href{http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c7/c7s2.htm}{"knowing basic
facts and concepts about science and having an understanding of how
science works."} Why is literacy important? Again,
\href{http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c7/c7s2.htm}{the NSF}: "It [literacy] is valuable not only in keeping up with important science-related issues, but also in evaluating and assessing the validity of any type of information and participating meaningfully in the political process."

The question we must then ask is, does the new wording measure scientific literacy better than the old wording? To do this, we need to outline the four possible types of people answering the two forms of the questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  people who answer "yes" to the old and "yes" to the new
\item
  people who answer "no" to the old and "no" to the new
\item
  people who answer "no" to the old and "yes" to the new
\item
  people who answer "yes" to the old and "no" to the new
\end{enumerate}

The wording change doesn't change cases 1 and 2, adds case 3 to the
"yes" category and it introduces the erroneous case 4. The cases can
be summarized in another way, like

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  people who know both that, say, the universe began with a big
  explosion and that astronomers claim that this is true. This is
  indicative of scientific literacy.
\item
  people who don't know, or do not believe, that the universe began with
  a big explosion and that also don't know that astronomers claim that this
  is true. This is indicative of scientific *illiteracy*.
\item
  people who don't *believe* that the universe began with a big
  explosion but know that astronomers claim that this is true. (more on
  this below)
\item
  people who know that the universe began with a big explosion, but do
  not believe that astronomers claim that this is true. This might at
  first seem to be a totally unreasonable and marginal case, but we think
  it is more significant than perhaps is generally appreciated. These
  people might think that the new wording is a trick question (e.g.~they
  might think, for example, that *physicists*, as opposed to astronomers, claim
  that it is true). I've had students answer questions in this way, so
  it is not quite as uncommon as one might think. These students
  overthink the problem: they know the fact, but are distracted by the
  extra complexity of the question, thinking that the test is trying to
  trick them.
\end{enumerate}

The only reason these particular questions were modified was because of
the prevalence of religious belief. How do we know this? We don't see a
proposal to change "The Earth orbits around the Sun and takes a year to
do it" to "According to astronomers, the Earth orbits around the Sun
and takes a year to do it." Why? Because no religion (now) has a stake
in the answer to that question, and thus have no objection to the claim.
Of course, if you go back to the days of Copernicus this was a different
story and people were severely punished for too strongly making such a
claim. The two questions that are proposed to be changed in this way are
precisely the two concepts that crop up in every creationist tract, and
are clearly the two major stumbling blocks for a literalist reading of
the Bible or the Quran.

{\textbf{Case 3: The Religious Believer}}

Aside from the motivation for the change, we can ask the question
whether it is accomplishing something important anyway. Are these Case 3
people, who would answer "no" to the old question but "yes" to the
new question, demonstrating scientific literacy?  No.  What they've confirmed is that they know that some scientists *claim*
that the universe began with an explosion, but they don't believe it.
This means that they don't accept either the data, or the methods, or both. If
the question were about something on the fringes of science, then
perhaps this is fine, but it isn't the case with these two questions.
Evolution theory, for example, is as well established as the Round Earth
theory and the Germ theory of disease. To deny it is to deny all of the
*independent* work in molecular biology, embryology, ecology,
etc\ldots{} that supports it. Even though they may know the fact that
biologists support Evolution theory, they have not demonstrated any
scientific literacy in terms of "evaluating and assessing the validity
of any type of information and participating meaningfully in the
political process." The same can be said of the Big Bang theory, to a
slightly lesser degree (i.e.~there isn't *quite* the volume of
completely independent *fields* of study supporting it, as there is
for Evolution, but the data is nearly incontrovertible anyway). To deny
either idea is akin to denying the Germ theory of disease.

Imagine someone answering "no" to the question "The world is round"
but answers "yes" to "According to geographers, the world is round".
Would they be demonstrating scientific literacy?  The difference between belief, knowledge, and the claims of others is quite apparent in this application.

            <Title>Will the Sun rise tomorrow?</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Continuing with the Miller-Croft debate, Miller eventually brings up the analogy with evidence for the sun coming up as an example of knowledge claims and models.  The analogy fails when we look at the details of how this evidence is calculated.

Calum Miller describes philosopher David Hume on the justification for the sun rising tomorrow, and then continues with the analogy of model building in this situation,

\pquote{Hume basically noted that we don't have any non-circular
justification for thinking that the universe will be regular, that it
will continue to be regular in the future.$\ldots$ He doesn't
just say that we have to be a bit unsure that the sun will rise
tomorrow, he says that we have no good reason at all for thinking the
sun will rise tomorrow. The most common justification that the sun will
rise tomorrow is that it has risen every day in the past. But then if
you compare two theories, one says that the sun rises everyday in the
past and in the future and the other theory says that the sun rises
everyday in the past but won't rise tomorrow. Both those theories
predict the observations we already have, both those theories lead us to
expect the observations, and so the observations we currently have don't
distinguish between these two theories. And yet one of those theories
predicts the sun will rise tomorrow and one of them predicts that the
sun won't rise tomorrow. So, even though we have those observations,
they don't really do an obviously good job of determining which of these
theories is true. $\ldots$ He is saying that the past observations
don't give us that good reason for thinking that the sun will rise
tomorrow. This is the Problem of Induction and has perplexed
philosophers for centuries.}

\subsection{What does Hume say?}

It is instructive to note that Hume predates the mathematics of probability, and see what Hume *actually* says about the Sun rising[@Hume:1748aa],
\pquote{
Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not
ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth,
however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of
every matter of fact is still possible, because it can never imply a
contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and
distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will
not rise tomorrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no
more contradiction, than the affirmation, that it will rise. We should
in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it
demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never
be distinctly conceived by the mind.}

Here Hume is essentially stating that all propositions have a non-zero
probability (however small they might be) unless they are
*logically* impossible. This is not saying, at all, that we have no
good reason to believe the sun will rise tomorrow.


\pquote{The bread, which I formerly ate, nourished me: that is, a body of such
sensible qualities was, at that time, endued with such secret powers;
but does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another
time, and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like
secret powers? The consequence seems nowise necessary.[@Hume:1748aa]
}

Again, although Hume predates probability theory, this is essentially
what he is saying - the consequence is not logically *necessary*
(i.e. \(P({\rm consequence}|{\rm observations})&lt;1\)). We see this as a
direct application of probability theory, a totally uncontroversial
application at that.

The so-called "problem of induction" to which Calum Miller refers is not really a problem. It is a direct consequence of the mathematics of probability, and thus is the result of mathematical axioms.  Hume is not claiming that there is *no* good reason to see the
consequence following from the the observations, only that he is unable to find a good reason,

\pquote{
The connection between these propositions is not intuitive. There is
required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference,
if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is, I
must confess, passes my comprehension, and it is incumbent on those to
produce it, who assert that it really exists, and is the origin of all
our conclusions concerning matter of fact.
}

The medium Hume refers to is simply the mathematics of probability,
something which post-dates Hume's writings. Hume was being honest that
he didn't see a way, and he did not claim that there was *no possible* way - that would be an "argument from ignorance" fallacy.

\subsection{What does Laplace say?}

Once we have probability theory, then we can actually do some simple
calculations concerning the probability of the sun rising tomorrow. Of
course these calculations are not a complete description of the problem,
but give the flavor of it. Laplace used the sunrise problem as an
example application of his Rule of Succession, which itself is derived
from the rules of probability. The calculation goes something like this.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Our model is that the sun rises with unknown probability \(p\)
\item
  Given complete ignorance of \(p\) we assume an initial uniform
  probability (all values are equivalent)
\item
  The sun has risen every day for the written record, say, 10000 years
\item
  the probability for rising tomorrow, which is also the mean value of
  \(p\) over the posterior probability, is given by the Rule of
  Succession[@Wikipedia:2015ab] (also known as the "assume one success and one
  failure”[@Blais:2014aa]):
\end{itemize}

\newcommand{\yr}{\mbox{year}}
\renewcommand{\day}{\mbox{day}}
\beqn
P\left(\parbox{.7in}{rise\\tomorrow}\middle|\parbox{1in}{rose today,\\rose yesterday, \\$\ldots$,\\ on day 0}\right)&amp;=&amp;
\frac{10000 \yr \times 365 \day/\yr+1}{10000 \yr \times 365 \day/\yr+2}\\
&amp;=&amp;0.9999997
\eeqn

It gets
messier when you can't even assume that both a failure and a success
are possible, but it can
still be done without any change to the qualitative result.

Clearly we have quite good reasons to believe the that sun will rise
tomorrow.

\subsection{Two theories}\label{two-theories}

We go back to Calum Miller's two theories:

\pquote{
If you compare two theories, one says that the sun rises everyday in the
past and in the future and the other theory says that the sun rises
everyday in the past but won't rise tomorrow. Both those theories
predict the observations we already have, both those theories lead us to
expect the observations, and so the observations we currently have don't
distinguish between these two theories.
}

The situation for arguing a high probability of tomorrow's sun rise is
far more compelling, however, because our information is not simply that
the sun has risen in the past, but includes observations of the patterns
of the seasons, the predictions of the phases of the moon and Venus, and
a whole host of other factors which significantly increase the chance
the sun will rise. Laplace knew this well, and was using this example
not as a serious calculation, but as a pedagogical example.

As a consequence, both of Calum Miller's so-called theories do *not*
predict the observations we already have - only one of them does. Even
if we accept just the observations for which both theories are
consistent in the past, one has to view this two-theory perspective from
the point of prediction. Imagine it's now tomorrow, and "Theory B" doesn't work - so we modify it to say the sun won't rise *tomorrow* (the new tomorrow). That next day comes with a sunrise, and this "Theory B 2.0" is wrong (again) and has to be modified (again). It is clear that "Theory B" fails, and we should be less confident in it. That's why, in science, it isn't nearly enough to be consistent with past data - one must make predictions, not just post-dictions, and test it. It is often trivial to come up with "explanations" for data we already have - especially when we can be infinitely plastic in the models we propose.

            <Title>Avoiding the Veneer of Objectivity</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

There is a danger of using mathematics to give the
veneer of objectivity to an argument that is riddled with random
guesses, ill-defined concepts, and unsupported premises. In this section, we analyze some statements made in a podcast debate between theist Calum Miller and atheist James Crofta, expressed as probability statements[@Brierley:2014ab].

\subsection{The Argument}\label{the-argument}

\ppquote{I think one useful way of thinking about is to consider
what evidence is in general. When we think about evidence for a theory,
in this case the theory is that God exists - we want to explain some
features of the world, we look for things (observations) which are
surprising if the theory isn't true but which aren't that surprising if
the theory is true.}{Calum Miller}

Calum Miller then goes on to do an analogy with fingerprints on a murder\TODO{include?}
weapon, as features of the world. He then points out the observation what he believes is evidence for God.

\ppquote{There are a number of arguments that work this way. But one of
the particular pieces of evidence that we want to discuss today is that
the world exhibits a real kind of regularity and there are basic laws,
science works, that we can understand the world. For all we know, the
universe could have been chaotic, might not have been any laws at all,
we might not have been able to do science - it might have been complete
chaos.}{Calum Miller}
\TODO{explain his quotes}

Here he's describing the form of the argument, as it might apply to the
sun rising.

\ppquote{Even more basic things that we use scientific reasoning for,
but do not always strike us as scientific truth. For example, *`the
sun will rise tomorrow'*. Most of us believe that; this is a
common-sense inference from our observations. On atheism there is no reason to expect that regularity, because the sun could just fail to rise tomorrow.  On theism we can expect that kind of regularity because God set it in place}{Calum Miller}

Calum Miller finishes by describing further how moral responsibility hinges on this regularity, because we need to know the likely effect of my actions on others in order to make moral decisions and be responsible for them. If things were chaotic, if my actions had random effects, then moral responsibility could not work.

\subsection{The problem with the math - posteriors vs
likelihoods}\label{the-problem-with-the-math---posteriors-vs-likelihoods}

The first problem with Miller's argument, from a math point of view, is that he is simply comparing *part* of Bayes' rule (i.e the likelihoods, or how well the explanation fits the data) without looking at the rest of Bayes' rule (i.e. how likely, a-priori, those explanations are).  He compares the terms

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm theism})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm atheism})}
\end{eqnarray*}

and says that this is greater than one, and thus theism is more
likely. That is just the wrong question to ask. What we really want to
look at, even keeping the same structure, is the ratio of the
*posterior* probabilities, or

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{P({\rm theism}|{\rm data})}{P({\rm atheism}|{\rm data})}
\end{eqnarray*}

which is related to the likelihood ratio through Bayes' rule:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{P({\rm theism}|{\rm data})}{P({\rm atheism}|{\rm data})} &amp;=&amp; \frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm theism})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm atheism})} \times \frac{P({\rm theism})}{P({\rm atheism})}
\end{eqnarray*}
where we factor in the *prior* probabilities. Already, we have an
issue, because the prior probability for the universe with an extra
agent should be smaller than one without such an agent\footnote{Recall this as a consequence of the Conjunction rule above.}. If you factor in
the agent with many specific properties, then this is smaller still.
By omitting this part, you could argue for anything. For example,

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm fairies})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm no-fairies})}&gt;1
\end{eqnarray*}
or, in other words, the regularity of the universe is much more likely given fairies than no-fairies, so that is evidence for the fairies. Even if true, it is clearly an uninteresting and not a useful claim.

\subsection{The problem with the premise regarding
theism}\label{the-problem-with-the-premise-regarding-theism}

The next problem is that it seems that Calum Miller is  trying
to sneak in many more details into his theism than his argument would
warrant. He needs to *define* what he means by theism to state that
it is more likely to result in a regular universe. This is where the mathematics forces one to be specific and thorough, and thus highlights problems in arguments that may seem fine at their face.

For example, a number of counter examples can be made:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Under the Greek pantheon, it is more likely that things *would be chaotic*, at the will of capricious deities - thus $P({\rm data}|{\rm theism})$ would be lower than Calum Miller claims
\item  Gods or divine beings, such as Cthulhu, revel in chaos and thus would make it even less likely to result in a regular universe
\end{itemize}

So when Calum Miller says "theism", what he seems to mean is the existence of "order-making God(s)", but then his argument is circular: a regular universe is more likely under a regular-universe-making God hypothesis than not.

\subsection{The problem with the premise regarding
atheism}\label{the-problem-with-the-premise-regarding-atheism}

Further, Calum Miller never supports that it is unlikely to have an ordered universe under atheism. "For all
we know, the universe could be chaotic", Calum says. However, that
needs to be *demonstrated*, not asserted, or it is an argument from
ignorance in disguise. It is possible, and in fact cosmology seems to be
pointing more in this direction, that the universe could not be any
other way - that the regularity is the result of the production of any
universe, and further that the production of universes is the only
stable solution. The notion of philosophical "nothing" may not be
physically realizable - it may be impossible for "nothing" to exist.[^Yes, I realize the verbal tangles one gets into with using the word "nothing" in the same sentence as "exists".  Unfortunately, I doubt English can do much better here.]


Calum Miller's introduction of morality to the argument adds nothing,
and only serves as a red herring. Without some regularity in the
universe, even thought itself would be impossible . We couldn't even
have the idea of a "being", or an animal, or life without regularity.
Thus, our mere existence requires regularity - but one that need not be
imposed from the outside, with a God. 

So, in summary, introducing the notion of a generic theism causes more problems to the argument than it solves, because it includes Zeus and Cthulhu. Circularity results when restricting the relevant theism to exclude these possibilities. Even if Calum Miller solved this, he is still answering the wrong question by ignoring the prior probabilities, and is at best achieving an uninteresting and useless result.

            <Title>Critique of Hume</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

One primary critique of Hume comes from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on miracles[@sep-miracles].  As we will see, this article does very little to modify Hume's conclusions, but we can use it as a good example of how to use probability mathematics to approach a philosophical article.

\subsection{Concepts and Definitions}\label{concepts-and-definitions}

The article begins by discussing one of Hume's definitions of a miracle
as ``a violation of the laws of nature''. From what I can tell, their
main critique is they don't like the connotations of the word ``law'', a
perspective I share - it is a bit loose terminology, with too many
alternate meanings to be the foundation of a well-defined argument.
Their revised definition is the following:

\begin{quote}
A miracle is an event that exceeds the productive power of nature
\end{quote}

Perhaps this is the scientist in me, and why I am not a philosopher, but
I don't see a striking difference between these two definitions in at
least how they are used. So it seems reasonable to adopt this as a good
working definition.

They go on to clarify a subset of miracle,

\begin{quote}
a religiously significant miracle is a detectable miracle that has a
supernatural cause.
\end{quote}

This clarification is to deal with the following problem, and I'd agree
with at least the sentiment.

\begin{quote}
An insignificant shift in a few grains of sand in the lonesome desert
might, if it exceeded the productive powers of nature, qualify as a
miracle in some thin sense, but it would manifestly lack religious
significance and count not be used as the fulcrum for any interesting
argument.
\end{quote}

I am not sure how, in practice, one would be able to determine a
``supernatural cause'', let alone establish how an event could be beyond
the ``productive power of nature'' without committing a fallacy of
\emph{argument from ignorance}, but let's leave that for now.

\subsection{Arguments for Miracle
Claims}\label{arguments-for-miracle-claims}

This section starts with a quick list of the types of evidence and
arguments made for miracles.

\begin{quote}
Many arguments for miracles adduce the testimony of sincere and able
eyewitnesses as the key piece of evidence on which the force of the
argument depends. But other factors are also cited in favor of miracle
claims: the existence of commemorative ceremonies from earliest times,
for example, or the transformation of the eyewitnesses from fearful
cowards into defiant proclaimers of the resurrection, or the conversion
of St.~Paul, or the growth of the early church under extremely adverse
conditions and without any of the normal conditions of success such as
wealth, patronage, or the use of force. These considerations are often
used jointly in a cumulative argument. It is therefore difficult to
isolate a single canonical argument for most miracle claims. The various
arguments must be handled on a case-by-case basis.
\end{quote}

All of these pieces of so-called evidence are the worst kind of
evidence, for which there are countless examples of the same, or similar
evidence use to shore up the claims of other (presumably false) beliefs.
You can think ``Mormonism'' or ``Alien Abductions'' for nearly every
point listed.

They then outline two types of inductive arguments:

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  the conclusion (in this case that the miracle in question has actually
  occurred) is probable to some specific degree, or at least more
  probable than not
\item
  the conclusion is more probable given the evidence presented than it
  is considered independently of that evidence
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

Point (1) is just either specifying either
\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})\) directly or establishing only that
\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})&gt;0.5\). Point (2) is
\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})&gt;P({\rm miracle})\). Point (2) is nearly
useless. For example, you could have

\begin{eqnarray*}
P({\rm miracle})&amp;=&amp;0.00001 \\
P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})&amp;=&amp;0.001
\end{eqnarray*}

and still have a seriously unlikely hypothesis, even given a factor of
100 increase in probability of a miracle given the data. Thus the
\emph{only} thing that matters must be the actual value of
\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})\).

One such argument for miracles specifies the type of evidence needed to
make one confident that one is talking about a miracle. The article
calls this a ``criteriological'' argument, but all of the arguments
dealt with are probabilistic. What are the criteria, for example? This
one is from Charles Leslie:

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  That the matters of fact be such, as that men's outward senses, their
  eyes and ears, may be judges of it.
\item
  That it be done publicly in the face of the world.
\item
  That not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but some
  outward actions to be performed.
\item
  That such monuments, and such actions or observances, be instituted,
  and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was done.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

One can easily site both the golden plates of Joseph Smith, and also the
events surrounding Roswell, that satisfy all of these. Clearly, there is
an issue with them.

Another common argument is called the ``minimal facts'' approach. The
best summary, and take-down of this argument is on
\href{https://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/}{Matthew
Ferguson's blog}. One essential missing part of the minimal facts
approach is that it only includes \emph{likelihoods} and not
\emph{priors}, and thus fails a basic probabilistic analysis.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic arguments}\label{probabilistic-arguments}

The first form here deals with \emph{testimony}, with the following
assumptions and conventions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \(T_i\equiv\) the proposition ``Witness \(i\) testifies to \(M\)''
\item
  \(P(T_i,T_j) = P(T_i)\times P(T_j)\): independence
\item
  \(P(T_i|M)=P(T_j|M)\) for all \(i\) and \(j\): all testimony is
  equally informative
\end{enumerate}

We then easily derive: 
$$
\frac{P(M|T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_n)}{P(\sim\!M|T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_n)} = \left(\frac{P(T_1|M)}{P(T_1|\sim\!M)}\right)^n \times \frac{P(M)}{P(\sim\!M)}
$$

The article then spins this in a positive way toward miracles:

&gt;If independent witnesses can be found, who speak
&gt;truth more frequently than falsehood, \emph{it is ALWAYS possible to
&gt;assign a number of independent witnesses, the improbability of the
&gt;falsehood of whose concurring testimony shall be greater than the
&gt;improbability of the alleged miracle.} (Babbage 1837: 202, emphasis
&gt;original; cf.~Holder 1998 and Earman 2000)

However, comparing with Hume, it becomes obvious why this spin fails:

&gt;When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to
&gt;life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable,
&gt;that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact,
&gt;which he relates, should have really happened. I weigh the one miracle
&gt;against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I
&gt;pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the
&gt;falsehood of the testimony would be more miraculous, than the event
&gt;which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my
&gt;belief or opinion. (Hume)

The first quote implies that the terms \(P(T_1|M)\) and
\(P(T_1|\sim\!M)\) refer to speaking truth vs falsehoods (i.e.~lying),
as opposed to speaking correctly vs being mistaken. In the latter, it is
very easy to see why, for certain types of extraordinary events, we
would expect fallible observers to have \(P(T_1|\sim\!M)&gt;P(T_1|M)\) and
further that even \emph{if} witnesses were in general slightly more
reliable than not, we can't expect the observations to be
\emph{independent} in general. In the specific case of the (anonymous)
Gospel writers, there is strong evidence of \emph{dependence} in the
accounts to make this entire calculation (except in its gross
qualitative features) irrelevant.

\subsection{Arguments against miracles}\label{arguments-against-miracles}

Quoting Hume again,

\begin{quote}
The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our
attention), ``That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle,
unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more
miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish: And even in
that case, there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior
only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which
remains, after deducting the inferior.''
\end{quote}

This is correct, and is a direct statement of Bayesian reasoning 
$$
\frac{P(M|E)}{P(\sim\!M|E)} =\frac{P(E|M)}{P(E|\sim\!M)} \times\frac{P(M)}{P(\sim\!M)}
$$ where we can use the approximations \(P(E|M)\approx 1\) and
\(P(\sim\!M)\approx 1\) and achieve $$
\frac{P(M|E)}{P(\sim\!M|E)} \approx \frac{P(M)}{P(E|\sim\!M)}
$$

The \href{http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/}{article on
miracles} continues to try to map this to a philosophical structure
(needlessly, I'd say), with the following ``simple version'' of the
argument:

\begin{quote}
A very simple version of the argument, leaving out the comparison to the
laws of nature and focusing on the alleged infirmities of testimony, can
be laid out deductively (following Whately, in Paley 1859: 33):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Testimony is a kind of evidence very likely to be false.
\item
  The evidence for the Christian miracles is testimony.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The evidence for the Christian miracles is likely to be false.
\end{enumerate}

This is, however, much too crude an argument to carry any weight, since
it turns on a simple ambiguity between all testimony and some testimony.
Whately offers an amusing parody that makes the fallacy obvious: Some
books are mere trash; Hume's Works are *some* books; therefore, etc.
\end{quote}

It's remarkable that such a silly parallel is seriously made. The
structure isn't really parallel at all, so let's make it explicit:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Books are likely to be trash. (in other words, most books are trash)
\item
  Hume wrote some books
\item
  therefore, Hume's books are likely to be trash.
\end{enumerate}

This is a correct argument, given the premises. If all we knew was that
``some guy named Hume'' wrote ``some book'', then with all probability
(if premise 1. is correct) that book would be trash. The issue is that,
unconsciously, we are inserting extra information - Hume was a famous
philosopher, he had a particular education, etc\ldots{} With this extra
information, we would have a hard time supporting a similar premise as
1. above.

The fact that this is so trivially dispensed with makes one wonder - why
would anyone be convinced by this? Why couldn't the author of the
article see it? It smacks of grasping at straws to try to dispel Hume's
main arguments.

The article continues with some odd re-phrasings of Hume, where the
mathematics is just the single line above. I don't understand all the
work. A strange one is then critiqued with an even stranger statement:
\textgreater{}The presumptive case against the resurrection from
universal testimony would be as strong as Hume supposes only if,
\emph{per impossible}, all mankind throughout all ages had been watching
the tomb of Jesus on the morning of the third day and testified that
nothing occurred. Even aside from the problems of time travel, there is
not a \emph{single piece} of direct testimonial evidence to Jesus'
non-resurrection.

Does anyone seriously think that the case against a claim always (or
even usually) takes the form of direct testimony against that claim?
Where is the testimony that Zeus didn't exist? Anyone who can explain
this odd line of reasoning, please chime in.

\subsection{Particular Arguments}\label{particular-arguments}

According to the article, Hume lists a set of conditions needed to make
testimony carry maximum weight:

\begin{quote}
There is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by
a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education,
and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of
such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any
design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of
mankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected
in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts, performed in
such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the world, as to
render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances are requisite
to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men. (Hume 1748/2000:
88)
\end{quote}

Essentially, he is saying that the methods of science have never
confirmed a miracle. The methods of science help ``secure us against all
delusion in themselves'', remove ``suspicion of any design to deceive
others'', with processes ``performed in a public manner'' that ``render
the detection unavoidable''.

It is criticized by noting that some of these conditions can cut the
other way, such as the condition of ``credit and reputation'',

\begin{quote}
It might have been said with some shew of plausibility, that such
persons by their knowledge and abilities, their reputation and interest,
might have it in their power to countenance and propagate an imposture
among the people, and give it some credit in the world. (Leland 1755:
90--91; cf.~Beckett 1883: 29--37)
\end{quote}

This is, essentially, pointing out fallacy of authority - a good
critique. Science, by its processes, attempts to avoid that as well. Of
course, Hume predates modern science, so I think we can forgive him some
sloppiness or poor choice of terminology.

Hume continues to suggest that the religious context of the miracle
claime makes the telling of the miracle story even more likely. This
would increase the probability of obtaining the testimony even if no
miracle happened - \(P(E|\sim\!M)\) increases - making the probability
of a miracle go down. The criticism here? The effect could happen in the
other direction:

\begin{quote}
But as George Campbell points out (1762/1839: 48--49), this
consideration cuts both ways; the religious nature of the claim may also
operate to make it less readily received:

\begin{quote}
The prejudice resulting from the religious affection, may just as
readily obstruct as promote our faith in a religious miracle. What
things in nature are more contrary, than one religion is to another
religion? They are just as contrary as light and darkness, truth and
error. The affections with which they are contemplated by the same
person, are just as opposite as desire and aversion, love and hatred.
The same religious zeal which gives the mind of a Christian a propensity
to the belief of a miracle in support of Christianity, will inspire him
with an aversion from the belief of a miracle in support of
Mahometanism. The same principle which will make him acquiesce in
evidence less than sufficient in one case, will make him require
evidence more than sufficient in the other\ldots{}.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

I disagree quite strongly with this line of thinking. One of the big
problems with pseudoscience is that it promotes poor thinking in other
domains. Someone who believes in miracles will not find it hard to
believe that the miracle claims of other religions are at least
possible. If you believe in unseen agents, then to move from
Christianity to New Age to Scientology isn't that large of a stretch.
Often, when ones religion is undermined, the typical response is to
switch to another religion! Thus, they are not as opposite as ``light
and darkness''. Poor thinking is poor thinking, regardless of the
context.

\subsubsection{Argument from Parity}\label{argument-from-parity}

Hume brings up miracles in other religions. In a fit of special
pleading, the \href{http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/}{article
on miracles} retorts,

\begin{quote}
All attempts to draw an evidential parallel between the miracles of the
New Testament and the miracle stories of later ecclesiastical history
are therefore dubious. There are simply more resources for explaining
how the ecclesiastical stories, which were promoted to an established
and favorably disposed audience, could have arisen and been believed
without there being any truth to the reports.
\end{quote}

The argument is quite simple - if there are known cases of miracle
claims where no miracle actually occurred, that increase
\(P(E|\sim\!M)\), making the probability of a miracle go down given
testimony. It doesn't matter whether you have good reasons to believe
there was no miracle for these cases - it undermines testimony of
miracles in general.

\subsection{In conclusion}\label{in-conclusion}

So, as far as I can tell, there is no substantive critique to Hume's
statements about miracles. He lacks the rigor of the mathematics of
probability, but his wording is so straightforwardly translated to it
that I find it difficult to see what the problem is. I also found it
ironic that the entire article, which has been pro-miracle the entire
time, ends with this:

\begin{quote}
For the evidence for a miracle claim, being public and empirical, is
never strictly demonstrative, either as to the fact of the event or as
to the supernatural cause of the event. It remains possible, though the
facts in the case may in principle render it wildly improbable, that the
testifier is either a deceiver or himself deceived; and so long as those
possibilities exist, there will be logical space for other forms of
evidence to bear on the conclusion. Arguments about miracles therefore
take their place as one piece---a fascinating piece---in a larger and
more important puzzle.
\end{quote}

This is pretty much exactly what Hume was saying. Given that there is
always a non-zero probability of the testifier either lying or being
mistaken, one has to establish the evidence for a miracle strong enough
to overcome both the negligibly small prior probability and this
non-zero probability of the testimony being wrong. Since mistakes are a
common human trait, and distortions are also common on testimony,
evidence for miracles according to probability theory, Hume, and all
rational thought have always been found lacking.

Fewer words are as loaded and lead to as much disagreement on definitions as the terms  *atheism* and *agnosticism* do.  In this work, we will define these words in a particular way, which we find the most consistent amongst the many different competing usages.  

* Theism and atheism refer to *belief*
* To be a *theist* simply means to believe in one, or more, personal gods.  This is in contrast to a *deist* who believes in an impersonal god - a god that, for example, created the universe and then stands back and doesn't interact at all with it.  As a result of this lack of interaction, deist beliefs are untestable - there can't be any consequences to measure a non-interacting god.  Because of this, deist beliefs are not addressed at all in this book.  Typically, we will be addressing the Christian or other monotheist arguments, but occasionally bring in polytheist beliefs as they apply.
* To be an *atheist* simply means that one does not *believe* in the existence of any gods.  It is a statement of being unconvinced.  It is not a statement of confidence that there is no God, just that the arguments for the existence of God is unconvincing.
* Gnosticism and agnosticism refers to *knowledge* (which is a subset of belief)
* *Agnostics*[^Sometimes an agnostic atheist is called a weak-atheist, and a gnostic atheist a strong atheist, but we find these terms a bit too pejorative to use.] believe that they cannot *know* whether there is a God or not, whole *gnostics* claim that *knowledge* can be had for (or against) the existence of God.  Thus, one can be an agnostic theist or agnostic atheist.  Also note, that *knowledge* is being used as described earlier, not as absolute certainty, but extremely high confidence. 


An analogy can help sort things out.  Say we have two explanations of the number of stars, one that
says there is an *even* number of stars and another that says
 there is an *odd* number of stars. Pretty much we know that,
at any given instant, one of these *must* be true. However, strong
belief in either one is completely unwarranted - there is simply no way
to know. From a probabilistic framework, we express this as

\begin{eqnarray*}
P({\rm odd}) &amp;=&amp;0.5 \\\\
P({\rm even})&amp;=&amp;0.5
\end{eqnarray*}
Anyone making the strong claim that, for example, $P({\rm even})&gt;0.95$ would have to present compelling evidence.  

* Someone who is an *evenist* (analogous to a *theist*) would be someone convinced by the evidence, and assigns a high probability for $P({\rm even})$.  
* Someone who is unconvinced by the evidence, say, an *a-evenist* (analogous to an *a-theist*) could maintain a lower probability for $P({\rm even})$.  
* A *gnostic evenist* would have a very high probability for $P({\rm even})$, while an *agnostic evenist* would have a high, but not very high, probability for $P({\rm even})$.  
* Likewise, a *gnostic a-evenist* would have a very low probability for $P({\rm even})$ (and thus a high $P({\rm odd})$), whereas an *agnostic a-evenist* would have a low $P({\rm even})$, and possibly equal to $P({\rm odd})$.  

Thus, for someone to be unconvinced of a “claim” (i.e. "there are an even number of stars") because they find the evidence unconvincing *does not* entail that they have a *belief* in the opposite (i.e. they do not necessarily believe there are an odd number of stars).  This point can't be made enough, because it is an extremely common misunderstanding, typically by Christians about atheists.

Matt Dillahunty clearly defines atheism as a lack of belief, and in a
court-room analogy says that he finds God "not guilty of existing". In
court, you find the plaintiff "guilty" or "not guilty", not
"guilty" or "innocent". The burden of proof lies squarely with the
prosecution. If they haven't met that burden, then the jury finds the
plaintiff "not guilty". They may, or may not, believe that the
plaintiff is innocent. Establishing *innocence* in the crime
changes the burden of proof to the defendant. The difference here comes
down to priors, which we can see through some illustrative examples
mapped to probability.

\subsection{Different Data}\label{different-data}

If we imagine data that might actually affect this prior probability,
the situation is a bit different. Let's imagine that through the laws of
physics we could demonstrate that

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  stars are nearly always formed in pairs
\item
  single stars are very short-lived
\end{enumerate}

we may actually have an argument for an even-number of stars in the
universe. In this case, we have $$
P(O|{\rm data}) \ll P(O)
$$ and thus $$
P(E|{\rm data}) \gg P(E)
$$

Where one belief goes down, the other goes up. For our belief in
odd-ness to go down our belief in evenness must go up. We no longer
simply *lack* a belief in odd-ness we also both *believe* in
even-ness and *believe* in non-odd-ness.

\subsection{More than two outcomes}\label{more-than-two-outcomes}

Something interesting happens when there are more than two outcomes.

$$
P(H)=P(R)=P(Y)=\frac{1}{3}
$$

Some data that nearly rules out one hypothesis, say \(R\), may not speak
to either other hypothesis directly, so you get the equal redistribution
like:

\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber P(R)&amp;\sim&amp; 0 \\\\ 
\nonumber P(H)=P(Y)&amp;\sim&amp; 1/2 
\end{eqnarray}

or it might be the case that the data leaves unchanged the prior
probability of one of the hypotheses, raising the probability of the
other, like

\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber P(R)&amp;\sim&amp; 0 \\\\ 
\nonumber P(H)&amp;\sim&amp; 1/3 \\\\
\nonumber P(Y)&amp;\sim&amp; 2/3 
\end{eqnarray}

Notice that it is possible to reduce the probability of one hypothesis
(i.e. \(R\)) and not effect the probability of a separate hypothesis
(i.e. \(H\)), when there are more than two outcomes. It is also possible
for the probability of that separate hypothesis (i.e. \(H\)) to go up,
or even go down. In other words, when there are more than one
hypothesis, presenting evidence for (or against) one hypothesis does not
always guarantee an adjustment in another hypothesis down (or up).

            <Title>Introduction to Miracles</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Perhaps the most influential work on miracles is the chapter ``Of Miracles'' in David Hume's larger work on reason[@Hume:1748aa].  It is also one of the most often \emph{misquoted} books as well.  For example, Normal Geisler misquotes Hume[@Brierley:2008ab], attributing the statement ``The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the rare.'' to Hume.  I think one of the reasons this occurs is that Hume predates probability theory, so he uses verbose explanations where the modern reader can insert a single statement. For example, reading Hume's work on Miracles, it is clear to me that what he intends to say is simply

\pquote{the prior probability for the regular is always greater than the rare}

a bit less pithy, but more correct (although Hume doesn't phrase it quite like that either). This is at least a factual statement - before the data, we should believe the regular over the rare. That doesn't imply that data couldn't convince us of rare events, it only implies that it is more difficult for data to convince us of rare vs regular events (i.e. you need better evidence for the rare).

In an Unbelievable podcast interview with apologist Norman Geisler[@Brierley:2008ab], Geisler uses the first "quote" of Hume above, and then argues that Hume must be wrong because science already accepts singular and rare events - the Big Bang, the origin of life, and macro evolution (this last one is, of course, neither singular nor rare). Geisler then concludes that miracles can exist! However, seen in the light of probability theory, it becomes clear. 

The prior probability of the events is low:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\mbox{Big Bang})\ll 1 \\
P(\mbox{Origin of Life})\ll 1 \\
P(\mbox{Macro Evolution})\ll 1 \\
P(\mbox{Miracles})\ll 1
\end{eqnarray*}
but with data, we have something quite different:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\mbox{Big Bang}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\
P(\mbox{Origin of Life}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\
P(\mbox{Macro Evolution}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\
P(\mbox{Miracles}|{\rm data})\sim  0
\end{eqnarray*}
where the data are

\bi
\i Big Bang - \href{http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html}{a long list}
\i Origin of Life - a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis}{nice summary} with RNA world, and autocatalysis
\i Macro Evolution - a term not used by biologists, but \href{http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/}{another long list} for evolution
\i Miracles - nothing convincing to the scientific community
\ei

So, although all these things \emph{can} occur, only a few of them \emph{actually} have evidence strong enough to overcome their initial low prior probability.  Hume recognized this for miracles, as was clear from his writings, although it would have been clearer had he had the benefit of probabilistic vocabulary.

            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

When we speak about probability, we speak about a percentage chance (0%-100%) for something to happen, although we often write the percentage as a decimal number, between 0 and 1.  If the  probability of an event is 0 then it is the same as saying that you are certain that the event will never happen.  If the probability is 1 then *you are certain that it will happen*.  Life is full of uncertainty, so we assign a number somewhere between 0 and 1 to describe our state of knowledge of the certainty of an event. The probability that you will get struck by lightning sometime in your life is $p=0.0002$, or 1 out of 5000. Statistical inference is simply the inference in the presence of uncertainty.  We try to make the best decisions we can, given incomplete information.  

Pierre-Simon Laplace, who first formalized the mathematics of probability, spoke of an agent with perfect knowledge.  This agent, Laplace claimed, would not need probability at all.

&gt;We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its
&gt;past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment
&gt;would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of
&gt;all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast
&gt;enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single
&gt;formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those
&gt;of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain
&gt;and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.[@laplace1825philosophical]

E.T. Jaynes describes it in much the same way.  He says that we label something “random” due to our ignorance of the system not to any intrinsic randomness.  He called this labeling the mind-projection fallacy[@Jaynes2003], where you misattribute the unpredictable behavior of a system as a product of the system itself. A rolled die is following the laws of physics, deterministically, and detailed knowledge of the die, the roll, and the surface should allow you to predict 100% of the time what it will do.  We lack that knowledge, thus the behavior becomes unpredictable. We often then attribute that unpredictable behavior as a ``random die'', as if it were the die that contains the randomness and not our own ignorance.

            <Title>Resurrection and Regression</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Dan Barker has written an Easter Challenge[@Barker:1992aa] for
any Christian to come up with a seamless account of what happened on the
day of the Resurrection.

\pquote{The conditions of the challenge are simple and reasonable. In each of
the four Gospels, begin at Easter morning and read to the end of the
book: Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and John 20-21. Also read Acts
1:3-12 and Paul's tiny version of the story in I Corinthians 15:3-8.
These 165 verses can be read in a few moments. Then, without omitting a
single detail from these separate accounts, write a simple,
chronological narrative of the events between the resurrection and the
ascension: what happened first, second, and so on; who said what, when;
and where these things happened.

Since the gospels do not always give precise times of day, it is
permissible to make educated guesses. The narrative does not have to
pretend to present a perfect picture--it only needs to give at least one
plausible account of all of the facts. Additional explanation of the
narrative may be set apart in parentheses. \emph{The important condition
to the challenge, however, is that not one single biblical detail be
omitted.}}

Andy Bannister has written a response to this challenge[@Bannister:aa], which we must admit is in fact consistent with every detail of the story and supposed contradiction.  In many ways it is impressive.  

\todo{describe his method here quickly}



However, there is a significant problem with the method he employs, which can be elucidated with an analogy to a situation which commonly arises in mathematics, in the process of fitting a line to data.

\subsection{Regression}\label{regression}

In linear regression, we might have, say, a handful of data points:

\vspace{.1in}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\toprule
\textbf{X} &amp; \textbf{Y}\\
0.0 &amp; -12.5\\
1.0 &amp; 17.9\\
2.0 &amp; -3.2\\
3.0 &amp; 11.4\\
4.0 &amp; 10.8\\
5.0 &amp; 28.8\\
6.0 &amp; 31.8\\
7.0 &amp; 28.3\\
8.0 &amp; 23.4\\
9.0 &amp; 21.9\\
10.0 &amp; 32.7\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.1in}

Which is plotted as

\includegraphics{fig1.png}

When we do a linear regression, we fit to a standard ``$y=mx+b$'' form.
For this data, the best fit is
\beqn
y=3.4 x + 0.27,
\eeqn
with a mean squared error of 77.9.  This difference from the line to the data is one measure of how well the line compares to the data - lower values means a better fit, a mean squared error of zero means a {\em perfect} fit.

\includegraphics{fig2.png}

Overall, not a bad looking fit. However, if we fit to a more complex function, say a 10$^{\rm th}$ polynomial, we can get even better!

\beqn
y&amp;=&amp;-0.0007039 x^{10}  + 0.0363 x^9 - 0.8051 x^8 + 10.04 x^7 - 77.13 x^6 +\\
&amp;&amp; 376.5 x^5- 1159 x^4 + 2152 x^3 - 2163 x^2 + 891.8 x^1 - 12.54
\eeqn

with a Mean Squared Error of {\em zero}.

\includegraphics{fig4.png}

In the field of statistics, this is referred to as {\em over-fitting}, and is
the result of fitting the variation and not the overall pattern. In other words, it is fitting the
meaningless differences from one point to another by adding a tunable
parameter for each detail in the data. With each new parameter we get a
``better'' fit, by the criterion of mean squared error, but we lose
sight of the meaning. This is the mathematical equivalent of losing
sight of the forest for the trees.

\subsection{Parameters and Ockham's Razor}

When fitting a line, the result is choosing the values of the parameters that have the highest probability given the data.  However, when those parameters can take on any possible value, the overall probability of the model is reduced - this is the probabilistic equivalent of Ockham's Razor which we've seen before in Section~\ref{sec:ockham} on page~\pageref{sec:ockham}.  

We make the problem worse by adding more and more parameters, giving more possible explanatory freedom to our model.  The more freedom we have in choosing the parts of the model, the less explanatory power this model actually has.  One way that statisticians avoid this problem is to fit the model to half of the data, and see how it works on the other half - a process called cross-validation.  A simple model, like a straight line, will do about as well on both.  An overly complex one will do well on the data used to fit it, but will do poorly on new data.

\todo{do an example of this in this case}


\subsection{Back to the Resurrection}\label{back-to-the-resurrection}

If we look at Andy Bannister's very clever solution, we notice something
quite interesting: for every single difference between the Gospel
accounts, he adds a detail not found in the story to explain it. One can
pretty much do this for any two accounts that don't say logically
contradictory things, and can be seen as an example of over-fitting. 

Another way of looking at it is that, if Bannister had constructed his story from, say, two of the Gospel stories and then compared it to the other two he'd have a problem.  Even if he took details from all four accounts, but constructed a story from half of them and then used the other half to confirm it wouldn't work.

As a result, the Easter Challenge, as phrased, is probably not a very good one. One can Rube-Goldberg a story together to fit any amount of details.  Perhaps that is the point, to highlight to what lengths someone has to go to in order to reconcile the four accounts.  However, we think something motivated from cross-validation might be a bit more persuasive.

            <Title>Personal Revelation as Evidence</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;


The definition of personal revelation is the idea that God speaks directly to an individual, who then communicates their message to others.  Unfortunately, there is never any way to confirm personal revelation, so can it be used as evidence for God?  yes, but not very good evidence.  This is due to the combination of two things:

1. The prior probability for God is low ($P(H)\ll 1$) and,
2. The probability that someone would make the claim of divine attention even if there is no divine is substantial ($P(C|\mathbf{not}\,H)\approx 1$)

The second point is because there is both a vested interest for someone to distort a message or claim divine support. In addition it is also quite common for people to mistakenly attribute agency to non-agent driven events as well as to see patterns where there are none.  These common human traits give rise to the following relationships,

The probability of the God hypothesis ($H$) given the claim of personal revelation ($C$) is

$$P(H|C) = \frac{P(C|H)P(H)}{P(C)}$$

The various terms, as discussed above, are

\beqn
P(C|H) &amp;\approx&amp; 1 \\
P(H) &amp;\ll&amp; 1 \\
P(C) &amp;=&amp; \underbrace{P(C|H)P(H)}_{\rm small} + \underbrace{P(C|\mathbf{not}\, H)P(\mathbf{not}\, H)}_{\rm large}
\eeqn

thus
\beqn
P(H|C) &amp;\approx&amp; \frac{\rm small}{\rm large}\\
&amp;\ll&amp; 1
\eeqn

which means that personal revelation is poor evidence for the existence of God.

Richard Swinburne has written[@swinburne2004existence][@swinburne2003resurrection] that a thorough probabilistic approach leads one to the conclusion that the resurrection is at least 97% likely. The calculation is definitely flawed, but how?  In order to explore this, we need to outline the actual argument.  This is a good example of obfuscation with probabilistic mathemetics.

            <Title>Communicating Science</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Joan Roughgarden in
\href{http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival}{Beyond
Belief} made a very astute observation of a problem, and then proposed a
lousy solution to it. The problem she was addressing had to do with the
public perception of evolution as something quite uncertain
scientifically ("theory vs fact"). She observed that the public sees
science changing its stance on many things, especially in medicine. One
day, you should eat bran. The next, bran is bad for you. The next, bran
is good for you again. As a result, the public observes that *some*
sciences are uncertain, and can't distinguish one field from another or
one type of claim from another, so they apply doubt to *all* of
science even when it is not warranted by the science. Her solution
involves using religious analogies, interpreting phrases in the Bible to
explain things like natural selection and mutations, in order to
communicate it to a group of people who share and value that vocabulary.
Dawkins rightly chews her out for this approach, pointing out how far
she is stretching the meaning of the phrases just to fit her philosophy.

The problem she is stating, however, is quite real. How can we expect
the public to make decisions about medicine, global warming, evolution,
the big bang, etc\ldots{} when they (somewhat rightly, somewhat wrongly)
observe that the scientists themselves are arguing about it? The
Intelligent Design proponents are currently using this observation to sow
doubt with the public in their efforts to "teach the controversy" of
evolution to inject creationism into the schools. It is a failure of the
scientists, and the media that covers them, to communicate with the
public. Can we do better?

Here is a proposal, which we'll sketch out in a simplistic, yet illustrative, example. The problem
is not the communication of facts, or even of the procedures of science.
The problem is with the communication of *uncertainties* - and thus the probabilities - associated with measurement. In day-to-day life, we easily handle claims with different levels of
uncertainties. The sun rises in the east each morning has low
uncertainty. The claims of the auto salesman or the politician have
higher uncertainty. Quantifying it is, of course, more challenging but
the qualitative features of uncertainty are known to nearly everyone. So
scientists and journalists really need to take efforts to communicate
the uncertainty of every claim, not just the fact of the claim or how
the new observations differ from the old observations. How could this be
done?  We think, at least roughly, one should include a plot of the
probability distribution with any claim. This distribution is a graphical representation of the weights of one's beliefs over all of the possible values of the measured quantity.  One doesn't need to know
advanced math to see the picture. If every claim is accompanied by a
plot of the uncertainties, the public will get used to reading them. Let
us demonstrate with a toy example.

Say, we are trying to determine the origin year of *homo sapiens*. We realize there isn't just one year, and there is a process, but it is not much harder to include those in this simple analysis.  We have several *homo sapiens* fossils where we've measured the age, allowing us to
calculate our best guess of the age, and the distribution of our
uncertainty shown here.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{blah2-2011-01-29-11-35.png}
\caption{Hypothetical distribution of ages for *homo sapiens*.}
\end{figure}

The details of this are unimportant, because the picture is pretty clear regardless of the details.  A few observations are in order here:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Our "best guess" is around the middle of this distribution, but it
  really can't be interpreted as "homo sapiens originated 250,000 years
  ago" as it might read in a newspaper
\item
  there are many possible values for the origin time of *homo sapiens* that lie well outside of our data yet have non-zero probability.  This means that these values could very well be the truth, and we are being up front about it.
\end{enumerate}

Now, we have a new paper that adds another fossil much older than than
the previous ones, around 340000 years ago. Currently, newspapers often make claims like "origin of homo sapiens 150\% older than originally thought", or "estimates of the origin of humans overthrown by new data". How might it look with the uncertainties plotted?

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{blah3-2011-01-29-11-35.png}
\caption{Hypothetical distribution of ages for *homo sapiens*, with one added data point.}
\end{figure}

There are a number of lessons that can be read from this.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  the new data updates our "best estimate" by only a little - the old
  data, combined with the new data, are used for the estimate
\item
  our uncertainties have widened - by having a larger range of data, our
  uncertainties may have increased with new data.
\end{enumerate}

In reality, estimating an origin (first event) will update a bit
differently than this example shows. For example, the uncertainties in
the right-half of the distribution may not be affected at all by an
older observation. If this data were in medicine, however, and we were
estimating the effect of some new treatment, then the update would be
very similar. A single result of a strong effect may not increase our
best estimate for that effect by a huge amount. The uncertainties in
many medical treatments, or dietary recommendations, straddle the
origin: there is significant probability for *no effect*. It would
be fruitful to see the plot of uncertainties, pushed a little this way
and that, updated in perhaps a wiki style by scientists as new data come
in. There would be many lessons, all of which would help the public
understanding of science.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  observations rarely overturn well-supported scientific understanding
\item
  not all topics have equal uncertainties - doubting everything the same
  amount is not rational
\item
  certainty is never an option, but sometimes the uncertainty is so low
  that there is a practical certainty
\item
  nature itself, not authority, determines our best guess and some of
  our uncertainty
\item
  if the thing you are measuring has a small effect, then you should
  expect a series of measurements of the effect to change sign: bran is
  good, bran is bad, bran is good, etc\ldots{}. This doesn't mean that
  the scientists are waffling, it only means that the effect is small
  and difficult to detect - and probably meaningless.
\end{enumerate}

I think the public could learn to, at least qualitatively, understand
and use plots like these. Perhaps there is a better way to display it
that does not do violence to the truth, and we'd be open to that.  We think getting in the habit of making plots like this would be good for the
scientist as well, forcing them to address and communicate the actual
uncertainties in their claims.  When we explore specific religions topic like miracles, this sort of thinking and communication of data could be critical.

            <Title>Another Interaction - McGrath and Dawkins</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

As part of the ``Root of All Evil'' program, Richard Dawkins conducted many interviews with theists.  One in particular, with theologian Alister McGrath, deals with the notion of faith[@Dawkins:aa].  They start with a discussion about the term \emph{faith}, and McGrath
says

\pquote{
We're dealing with a different situation than, for example, evidence
that the moon orbits the earth at a certain distance
}

and

\pquote{
There are many possible ways of explaining *the world*, and we have
to make the very difficult judgement of which is the best of these
*explanations* $\ldots$ evidence takes us thus far, but then when it
comes to deciding between a number of competing explanations, it is
extremely difficult to make an evidence-driven argument.
}

and

\pquote{
I believe faith is rational, in the sense that it tries to make the best
possible sense of things $\ldots$ even though we believe this is the best
possible sense of things, we cannot \emph{prove} this is the
case $\ldots$ there is a point where *faith* goes \emph{beyond} the
evidence
}

By this point, the reader should be able to tell that McGrath is employing the {\em belief} part of the expected utility form of {\em faith}.  One wonders in these cases why he doesn't simply talk about evidence, and the weight of
probabilities? Historians, for example, don't use the word \emph{faith}
even though they deal with probabilities, some of which are highly
uncertain. Scientists all the time deal with probabilities, without
invoking the word \emph{faith} in any paper.

Further, McGrath ignores the fact that there already is a proper and
rational method to address the ``decision between a number of competing
explanations'', that \emph{doesn't} go beyond the evidence, and doesn't
claim more knowledge than is justified. What is this method? It's called
the mathematics of probability! So, McGrath is claiming there is a
problem that faith solves, which is not a problem at all, and he is
using the word faith (at the moment) as synonymous with probability.

Why is he doing this? It seems as if it is because McGrath is holding to
a double standard, and shifts the definitions of concepts around
whenever pressed. He doesn't like the notion of believing strongly
without sufficient evidence (which, as we've seen, is one use of the word faith), so he
defines it (at the moment) to be equivalent to probabilities.

\subsection{Inference to the Best Explanation}

Then McGrath continues to talk about probabilistic reasoning,
and says that with faith one is doing \emph{inference to the best
explanation}, given a number of competing multiple explanations. As we
stated earlier, if all he means is that faith is probabilistic
reasoning, then we don't have an argument - except that we think he can make things more clear. We would contend, along with Dawkins, the \emph{vast} majority of people do not take it to mean this - even the notion of {\em faith} as {\em trust} isn't the same as this.

However, we'd like to challenge his basic premise: that in
dealing with multiple competing explanations that one should try to
``infer to the best explanation'', and \emph{believe strongly in that
explanation}. A simple example introduced in Section~\ref{sec:atheism_agnosticism} on page~\pageref{sec:atheism_agnosticism}, suffices to see this. In this example, we have two explanations of the number of stars, one which
says that there is an \emph{even} number of stars and another that says
that there is an \emph{odd} number of stars. Pretty much we know that,
at any given instant, one of these \emph{must} be true. However strong
belief in either one is completely unwarranted - there is simply no way
to know. From a probabilistic framework, we express this as

\begin{eqnarray*}
P({\rm odd}) &amp;=&amp;0.5 \\
P({\rm even})&amp;=&amp;0.5
\end{eqnarray*}

However, it is worse than that. Let's say we had a smidgen of evidence
toward the even-star model, such that we had:

\begin{eqnarray*}
P({\rm odd}) &amp;=&amp;0.499995 \\
P({\rm even})&amp;=&amp;0.500005
\end{eqnarray*}

Even though there is a \emph{best} explanation here (\emph{even} is
slightly more probable than \emph{odd}), and we have the exact
probabilities, it is \emph{still irrational} to hold strong belief in
either explanation. One really does have to look where the weight of the
probabilities lay. Inference to the best explanation fails as a guiding
principle in the face of uncertainty, and is not well defined in all
contexts. 

What is happening here is that on the face of it, ``inference to the best explanation'' sounds like a great thing - something we should always strive for.  However, when you look at what it {\em actually} means, it falls short unless you are in a situation where the best explanation is also very probable.  Strong belief is only justified when the claim is very probable, not just that is is the most probable amongst a number of (possibly nearly equivalent) alternatives.


\subsection{Shifting Sands}\label{playing-dodgeball-with-an-apologist}

One of the benefits of seeing these arguments in the light of the framework of probability is that it makes one sensitive to shifting definitions.  We saw that earlier in Section~\ref{sec:mcgrewresponse} where Tim McGrew changes his usage of the term {\em faith} depending on the response.  Here, McGrath does the same thing.

First it was ``faith is reasonable'', based on evidence, going beyond the evidence to the ``inference to the best explanation'' and that as a result one can have a reasonable faith in God.  Then, when asked about his belief in a creator, and the evidence for it,  despite having difficulty with the implied complexity of such a creator, he says

\pquote{
I want to go back to CS Lewis who says I believe in Christianity as I
believe the Sun has risen, not simply because I see \textbf{it} by
\textbf{by it} I see everything else. Belief in God gives you a way of
seeing the world that makes an awful lot of sense of it.
}

When pressed on what this implies, he says that 
\pquote{there are many
  reasons I believe in God and that *origins* is not even the
  primary one...religion really isn't much about where things came
  from, about things in the distant past, but really about how things
  are now. How to live your life, how to be moral, etc\ldots{}
  }
which then becomes 
\pquote{the key reason for believing God is Jesus, that
  there is something *in the Jesus story* that needs explanation.
}
and then, this becomes that it is not really about the life of Jesus, and his historicity, but how he was perceived by his followers - the significance they saw in the life and teaching of Jesus.

Notice how this keeps shifting? At first, it is about belief, and then it is about significance (which one could argue is a kind of utility).  Every time he gets pushed on the
specific consequences of his statement, he retreats, redefines, and
redirects the conversation.

He doesn't seem to realize that any explanation, even of things
currently, entails assumptions that can be tested - perhaps with
observations about the past. He can't simply say that religion is ``not
about where things came from'', when they explicitly make statements of
origins - statements which have been universally discredited. The
atonement, for example, \emph{does} depend critically on the existence
of Jesus, the existence the ``Fall'', and a creator of the universe -
for none of which did McGrath provide evidence. If Jesus didn't exist as
a real person (or even if he was just an ordinary guy) then it doesn't
matter that his followers simply \emph{believed} that Jesus was God
incarnate when determining ones belief in the doctrine of salvation. The
demonstration of the historicity of the events claimed is
\emph{necessary} for the doctrinal belief. If you don't have strong
evidence of the former, then you are not rational to believe strongly in
the latter - you'd be claiming to know things you could not know.

As a scientist, one takes an idea, and pushes the idea to it furthest
consequences to see where it breaks, or to see what it depends on.
McGrath seems to change the topic whenever this is done - he does not seem to want to
face the very real, specific consequences of his stated beliefs and
refuses to see the connections between the things that may be
confirmable (apparent design in the biology and the universe itself,
historicity of people and events, alleged miracle claims, etc\ldots{})
and the things that make him feel good, but are unmeasurable (existence
of heaven, the atonement of sins, etc\ldots{}).

            <Title>Does Science Have Faith</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

In his talk, "Life: Creation or Evolution”[@Miller:2009aa], Ken Miller makes the point that science should inform
faith and faith should inform science. He cites Paul Davies, a physicist
who has an interest in theism, and whose article
"Taking
Science on Faith”[@davies2007taking] takes the position that science itself is a
faith-based activity. Ken Miller points out, and one can confirm in Paul
Davies' article, that there are two tenets in science that are taken on
faith:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  the universe is ultimately knowable and understandable
\item
  knowledge is better than ignorance
\end{enumerate}

These concepts, however, are fundamentally different than faith, or even axioms.  Even here, it is plain that the claims are referring to the *belief* part of faith, and not the *trust* part of faith.  The entire phrase "taken on faith" is a signal to the listener that this is so.


The first idea, that the universe is knowable, needs to be a bit more specific: what does it mean to be *knowable*? Prior to 1900, it was
believed that the pieces of a physical model, such as the force of
gravity, or the electric and magnetic fields of Maxwell were "real":
there was one-to-one correspondence between the model components and
things in the real world. Thus, it was believed, that knowing the model
you would know nature. After 1900, with the advent of quantum mechanics,
physical models were evaluated based on their predictive value: those
models that predicted well were good models. It was not believed that
there was necessarily a correspondence between the model components and
the real components in nature. Aspects of the model, such as the wave
function in quantum mechanics, were not believed to be real but simply useful in making
predictions. To know the world is to be able to predict what would
happen.

Let's say we replace "understandable" with "predictable", a
replacement which we think makes practical sense (how else would you
determine that you understand something?), and is directly in line with
modern physical thinking. Doing this, then tenet (1) ceases to be an
axiom, or something we take without sufficient evidence ("on faith"), but is observable. If the universe
is unpredictable, then all attempts at making prediction will fail. This
is not what we observe at all. Surely there are still things that are
unpredictable, such as the simultaneous value of the position and
momentum of the electron, or the positions of every molecule of air in
this room, but even there we can make specific predictions about average
quantities or the values of other variables of interest. Practically,
the universe has demonstrated itself to be understandable, on the whole.
This is not a matter of faith.

The second tenet (2) I would wager is too vague. What does "better"
mean? Better for whom, or for what? Psychologically, one might argue
something akin to "ignorance is bliss", and there might be something
to that. If we define, however, "better" to be higher standard of
living (longer, healthier, more free life) then knowledge can be argued
to have a demonstrable benefit over ignorance. The results of science
has doubled the life expectancy in the past 100 years, and has allowed
us to live more free and healthy lives.  As Carl Sagan says, science delivers the
goods. Is there any convincing argument that ignorance is better, or
that we really can't decide which is better? 

There is a danger in using the word *faith* in these contexts.  It can communicate to the unaware that there are things that one should justifiably believe on insufficient evidence - a direct violation of the laws of probability.  It can also imply, for those who take *faith* to mean *trust*, that the scientists using the term are somehow admitting an agency in the universe that they don't intend.  It serves only to propagate sloppy thinking in both the fields of science and religion.

            <Title>Simplicity</Title>
            <Text>### &lt;$Title&gt;

Ockham's razor, which is the philosophical idea that simpler theories are preferred, is a consequence of Bayes' rule when comparing models of differing complexity[@jefferys1991sharpening].  We can see this by extending the card game example with a fifth possibility.  Instead of giving the specific cards in this deck, we are simply told

1. $E_5:$ the deck can have anywhere from zero to three $3\spades$, and enough other cards to make a total of four cards

This explanation of the game is plastic - depending on the data, we may infer a different value for the number of $3\spades$ in this deck[^adjustable].  It may be heavily loaded toward $3\spades$, which would make $E_{5}$ explain the data very well; however it may have none, and not explain the data at all.  Clearly, once you observe a $3\spades$, the ``best'' value for this deck is to have three of them out of the four cards - making it more likely than the previously best explanation, $E_4$, which only had two our of four.
 
[^adjustable]: In mathematical models, this is often referred to as having an *adjustable parameter* - a value in the model that is not specified ahead of time, but can be *fit* to the data, and an optimum value found.

However, this process of reasoning violates the laws of probability by not taking our uncertainty of this parameter (i.e. the number of $3\spades$  in the deck) into account.  For simplicity, let's just consider the two decks in question, $E_4$ and $E_5$, and play the game with them (again, as before, drawing a $3\spades$ from the top).

1. $E_4: A\hearts,3\spades, 3\spades, 4\spades$
2. $E_5:$ the deck can have anywhere from zero to three $3\spades$, and enough other cards to make a total of four cards

We set up the calculation as before

\beqn
P(E_4|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{P(3\spades|E_4)P(E_4)}{P(3\spades)}\\
P(E_5|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{P(3\spades|E_5)P(E_5)}{P(3\spades)}
\eeqn
We defer the calculation of the shared term, $P(3\spades)$, and focus on the numerators of both calculations.\marginnote{Once we have the numerators, we can add them up to get the shared term $P(3\spades)$}  First the one for $E_4$ (and remember, we have only two decks here),

\beqn
P(E_4|3\spades)&amp;\sim&amp;P(3\spades|E_4)P(E_4)\\
&amp;=&amp;(2/4)\times (1/2) = 1/4
\eeqn
Next with the $E_5$ deck,

\beqn
P(E_5|3\spades)&amp;\sim&amp;P(3\spades|E_5)P(E_5)\\
&amp;=&amp;\underbrace{P(3\spades|E_5)}_{\parbox{1.4in}{broken up into the four possibilities from zero to three $3\spades$}}\times (1/2) \\
\eeqn
Each of the possibilities (all equally likely, because we are given no other information) has the form of the fraction of $\spades$ for that possibility times 1/4 because there are 4 total possibilities to consider, for example

\beqn
P(3\spades|E_5\mbox{ {\bf and zero }} 3\spades)P(\mbox{zero } 3\spades|E_5) &amp;=&amp; \underbrace{(0/4)}_{\mbox{\#}\spades} \times (1/4)
\eeqn
Doing the same for all the possibilities, we get for the $E_5$ numerator,

\beqn
P(3\spades|E_5)P(E_5) &amp;=&amp;\left[(0/4)\times (1/4) +  (1/4)\times (1/4) +  (2/4)\times (1/4) +  (3/4)\times (1/4)\right]\times (1/2) \\
&amp;=&amp;3/16
\eeqn
Finally, we can get the shared term, 

\beqn
P(3\spades)= 1/4 + 3/16 = 7/16
\eeqn
and the probabilities of each of the decks, given the observation of a $P(3\spades)$,

\beqn
P(E_4|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{1/4}{7/16} = 4/7\\
P(E_5|3\spades)&amp;=&amp;\frac{3/16}{7/16} = 3/7
\eeqn
This means that, although $E_5$ contains the *possibility* of a better fit to the data, it is less *probable* because it has a flexible parameter that is unspecified *before* the data.

When we prefer a “simpler” model with Ockham's razor, simpler means fewer such adjustable parameters.  It also means that the predictions are both*specific* and not *overly plastic*. For example, a hypothesis which is consistent with the observed data, and also be consistent if the data were the opposite would be overly plastic.  An example of an infinitely plastic “explanation” is *magic did it*.  Because it can “explain” anything, given that it is consistent with any possible observation, it explains nothing.

\subsubsection{Notes}\label{notes}

Stephen - \emph{``I'm a church-going, Bible-reading agnostic''}

\textbf{Me - That's pretty funny, because it is very close to what I am.
I am a church-going, Bible-reading atheist. Although I have read the
Bible at least once cover-to-cover a few years ago, I have lost patience
with reading it now. There is so much repetitious and tedious material,
both Old and New Testament, that I find it hard to read for long without
thinking I have better things to do with my time.\\}

Stephen - There are a large number of \emph{``miracles''} that aren't
miracles at all, and non-Christians can have healings as well.

Heather - Her story is at 24:40, in case you want to listen to the
original. Here is a quick summary. She pursued a psychology degree,
studied the paranormal. About 3 or 4 months ago, she went to a
chiropodist (aka podiatrist) who told her that one leg was longer than
another (by an inch). She then went, unplanned, to a religious
gathering. During the meeting the preacher gave her some very specific
information about he from several years ago, some comforting words, and
a moving message. And then he healed the asymmetric leg. She said she
felt like she was \emph{``on show''} and that \emph{``God's really got
to do something''}. She also said that she didn't feel any different,
but a friend of hers observing saw the leg lengthening. So then she went
back to the chiropodist. She determined he was Christian, told the
entire story, he repeated the measurement and then did some more
\emph{robust} measurements, and found no difference in leg length. And
since then, her shoes are no longer asymmetric.

Stephen - People have done studies of faith healings and always come up
short.

\textbf{Me - When I first heard that story, a year or so ago when I
first listened to this episode, I recall being pretty impressed with the
healing. Since then, after much reading, and hearing this again I am
not. (It is interesting that I recall it being more impressive, and if I
never heard the story again, might have started to spread a more
impressive story if I told it again. This is a nice reminder of how
these stories, working with the limitations of memory, can grow in the
telling and quickly become unfactual).\\}

**\\Anyway, why am I not impressed? There are a number of little details
that she dropped in that I find curious. Consider two models (there are
probably more!):**

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{There is a God, and he decides to heal this leg, but not other
  ailments, and not her husbands problems. This is hard to reconcile
  even on the face of it, and later in the show she talks about this
  somewhat.}
\item
  \textbf{There is no God, these things don't happen, and there are
  other mundane explanations}
\end{enumerate}

**\\Turns out that leg-lengthening is a very common form of
\emph{``healing''} in these sorts of situations (see ``The Faith
Healers'' by James Randi), because it looks impressive and is a
straightforward trick. That's why it is important to have magicians as
well as scientists investigate such claims, because scientists are
terrible at detecting dishonesty and trickery. The fact that she had no
idea that one leg was longer, until a few days before, that she did not
feel the healing, and only went on the word of the friend because she
was expecting something to happen, that she was impressed with the
\emph{``prophecy''} that the preacher said, referring to things he would
have no idea about. James Randi speaks about this at length, and shows
how preachers will use planted people, microphones, and other techniques
to appear to know things they wouldn't already know. Even if they aren't
being deceptive, they may hear in conversations with the friends ahead
of time about Heather's problems, and then work it into the
\emph{``prophecy''}. When she goes back to the chiropodist she finds out
he is a Christian, and \emph{before} he redoes the measurement she tells
the story. Now, this chiropodist has a vested interest in confirming the
healing, because it will confirm his worldview. This is why we have
double-blind measurements, because we \emph{know} people bias the
measurement, the reporting, the memory of it because of their worldview.
In fact, she tells that the chiropodist had to do more robust
measurements to confirm the equal leg length. Perhaps there was an error
in the first measurement. Perhaps the first measurement was
overestimated. Perhaps it wasn't, and \emph{she} reported it rounding up
(i.e.~he says a bit more than 1/2 inch, she tells her friends around an
inch, and then remembers it as such, etc\ldots{}). Perhaps the equipment
for the first test has a bias, which might have motivated him to make
the more robust measurements. There are many possibilities that do not
require dishonesty, deliberate deception, incompetence, and are
completely mundane.**

\textbf{So which model can explain each of these? It seems clear to me
that there are perfectly good mundane explanations for nearly every
detail of the story, that the story is inconsistent even with a
\emph{``real''} healing, and that model 2 is definitely better. What
about her asymmetric shoes, and the pain that occured and went away
after a while after the \emph{``healing''}? My shoes tend to get
asymmetric over time (not with each other, but each pushed off to the
outside) and when I get new shoes, and they are flat, I have a little
pain walking and running that goes away as I adjust. Notice that these
events happened \emph{3 or 4 months ago}. There is no way that her new
shoes would have become asymmetric in that time \emph{anyway}.\\}

John - \emph{``There is an awful lot of anecdotal evidence, and I don't
want to be skeptical of it simply because it is not documented. What
else\ldots{}.is she not telling the truth? Of course she's telling the
truth!''}

\textbf{Me - All we need is a slightly overzealous preacher, a slightly
sloppy chiropodist, and a small amount of congitive bias. It really is
that simple, and it doesn't require us to disparage the character of
\emph{anyone} in the story.}

John - \emph{``How high should we set the bar to know that this is a
proper healing story?''}

John - \emph{``For some people they want to make it so hard to call it a
miracle that nothing could ever satisfy that. I want to take Heather's
story, listen to it, and ask `How did it change her'? If it is a story,
told with integrety, seems to have a lasting effect, of course it would
be better if it were documented, but we don't have the ability to get
the documentation.''}

**Me - I listen to this talk about documentation, and about how it's
*``so hard*``, some people are \emph{``so skeptical''} and I have to
think \emph{``cry baby, cry baby, cry baby''}. I even hear the little
whining voice in my head.\\\emph{``People should be more believing of my
miracle claims''}, \emph{``You're being too skeptical''}, etc\ldots{} Of
course, when it comes to \emph{other} people's miracle claims, they are
just as skeptical! It's only the ones that support their worldview that
they consider for special treatment. Sorry, that's not good enough. Even
Heather points this out, saying that she feels that people are more
skeptical of religious claims than claims of the paranormal (which she
saw in her studies of the paranormal). She's noting, in others, the same
thing she is doing with her worldview. I've posted specifically about
\href{https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/naturalistic-bias-presupposing-naturalism/}{this
problem here}.**

**\\In science, say you are trying to publish a paper, and the editor or
reviewer returns it saying that they are not convinced of your
conclusions, you don't go \emph{``Oh, you're being too hard on me, too
skeptical. Getting the documentation for this effect I am claiming
exists is just too hard.''} That is just ridiculous. You find a way to
document it, with careful measurements, and you convince the skeptics if
it is true, or not if it is false. Truth should convince even the
skeptics, especially if you're claiming a large effect.**

**\\Take the Higgs boson, as an example of an unseen entity for which we
only can get indirect inference of its existence. It was proposed
\emph{50 years ago}, and although people may have thought it was likely
to be there, they didn't \emph{believe} it was there until the proper
measurements were done. Measurements which took decades to set up,
required hundreds of people as a team, and has cost billions of dollars,
just to get the documentation for the existence of something which
doesn't even seem to violate physical law. Think about that next time
you hear someone claim that getting documentation for healing is hard,
or that the effect seems to disappear whenever you look into it
carefully, and that is the reason there isn't any evidence for it.**

\textbf{If the claimed effects of so-called faith-healings are real,
they should be \emph{trivial} to demonstrate, document, and convince the
skeptics.}

            <Text>#### Rule 4 (Bayes' rule):

 This rule is perhaps the most obtuse to see for the first time, but is by far the most important rule of them all, so it is worth the effort.  Because of this, we will choose to write it in a somewhat more elaborated form, and rewrite it several ways.
\beqn
\Pg{explanation}{data} = \frac{\Pg{data}{explanation}\P{explanation}}{\P{data}}
\eeqn
where each term is described more fully as 

1. $\P{explanation}$ - this is the probability the explanation is correct *prior* to seeing the data.  The term itself is often called the *prior*, and represents your beliefs before you see the data.  Typically, more complex explanations are less likely a-priori than simpler ones.  
2. $\Pg{explanation}{data}$ - this is the probability the explanation is correct *after* seeing the data (a-posteriori). The term itself is often called the *posterior* for this reason, and represents your updated beliefs once you have data.  Thus, Bayes' rule is a mathematical expression of *learning* from evidence.  
3. $\Pg{data}{explanation}$ - this is the probability that the data can be explained with this particular explanation.  The term itself is often called the *likelihood*, and can be thought of as a measure of how well the explanation fits the data.  If the explanation fits the data well, this number will be high, for example. 
4. $\P{data}$ - this is the probability of the data, regardless of the explanation.  It is easiest to understand this term with an example.

            <Title>Faith and Trust</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

We see the same structure occurring in an "*Unbelievable*" podcast[@Brierley:2014aa] between theist Tim McGrew and  Peter Boghossian.  Because they were not thinking in terms of the framework presented here, they talked past each other through most of the episode.  In this discussion, Boghossian insists that faith is "belief without evidence" or "pretending
to know things you do not know", and Tim McGrew insists that faith is more like trust.  The discussion then devolved into a back and forth with both sides claiming that "all the people I know use my definition", and was generally unproductive.  It is clear, however, that in the expected utility equation,
\beqn
\langle U_{\mbox{action $A$}} \rangle &amp;=&amp; \P{outcome 1}\times U(\mbox{outcome 1}|\mbox{action $A$}) + \\
&amp;&amp;\P{outcome 2}\times U(\mbox{outcome 2}|\mbox{action $A$}) + \\
&amp;&amp;\vdots
\eeqn
Boghossian is focusing on the probabilities ($\P{outcome 1}$, $\P{outcome 2}$, etc...) and McGrew is focussing on the utilities ($U(\mbox{outcome 1}|\mbox{action $A$})$, $U(\mbox{outcome 2}|\mbox{action $A$})$, etc...)  

\subsection{The Discussion}

McGrew says that very few Christians (less than 1\%) would use Boghossian's definition of faith, "pretending to know things you do not know".  We agree that no Christian would *articulate* this definition of
faith, however they may be *functionally* using it, which we will
address later.

McGrew opens with 
\pquote{Faith is trusting in, holding to, and acting on what one has
good reason to believe is true in the face of difficulties. The
difficulties may be where you have to take an action where the outcome
is beyond your control.}

The example he gives is jumping out of an airplane, where one has
faith in ones instructor to have packed your parachute properly. Ones
act of jumping draws the distinction between faith and *hope* (if you just *hoped* your instructor packed it, you wouldn't jump), and the decision is made in the face of evidence, not despite it or without it.

Boghossian's general strategy is to ask a series of questions, to try to highlight the critical points.  For example, we get the following exchange:
* Boghossian: *"what do people mean when they accuse someone of having
`faith in evolution' "*?
* McGrew: *"You're trusting in something that you cannot completely verify because it doesn't lie open to your senses."*
* Boghossian: *"what do people mean when they say `I don't have enough
faith to be an atheist' "*?
* McGrew: *"They have belief in something in the face of certain difficulties, where the weight of the difficulties is greater on one side compared to the other."*
* Boghossian: *"Why don't we say that we have faith in the
existence of chickens?"*
* McGrew:  *"We are venturing nothing on the existence of chickens. When I believe that chickens exist and I act on that belief I am not taking any step that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control. [In the case of religion], people are placing the outcome of their eternal soul out of their control. They are taking a risk where the outcomes matter. The decision itself is evidenced but the outcome is
uncertain."*
* Boghossian: *"Do you have faith or evidence that Islam is
false?"*
* McGrew: *"Why would I use the word `faith' when I am venturing nothing on Islam?
I am a little bit confused about the framing of the question that way. I
think I have evidence that it is false, but since I am not venturing on
Islam, I'm not sure why the word faith would come in."*


\subsection{Addressing the Definitions}\label{addressing-the-definitions}

Clearly claims using expected utility require that probability
assignments have already been made, so claims of utility must
necessarily be probability claims as well. When translated into these
more precise terms, both McGrew's and Boghossian's claims begin to make more
sense. It will also show that McGrew is in fact using the Boghossian's definition, in
some cases even while denying it.

\begin{quote}
You have faith that your instructor packed your parachute, as opposed to Peter packing it.  Your act of jumping makes faith more than simply hope (if you just hoped your instructor packed it, you wouldn't jump), and the decision is made in the face of evidence, not despite it or without
it.
\end{quote}

The equations are:
\beqn
\langle U_{\mbox{jump}}\rangle &amp;=&amp; \P{instructor packed}\times \Ug{instructor packed}{jump} + \\
&amp;&amp; \P{Peter packed}\times \Ug{Peter packed}{jump} \\
\langle U_{\mbox{don't jump}}\rangle &amp;=&amp; \P{instructor packed}\times \Ug{instructor packed}{don't jump} + \\
&amp;&amp; \P{Peter packed}\times \Ug{Peter packed}{don't jump}
\eeqn
with a possible utility table

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Utility (benefits and costs)}}  \\ \midrule
 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{*Who packed the parachute?*}  \\ 
  &amp; \textit{Instructor } &amp; \textit{Peter}\\
\textit{jump} &amp; 100 &amp; -10000   \\
\textit{don't jump} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.1in}

For this analysis to work, we would have at least,
* $\P{instructor packed} \sim 1$: one is nearly certain the instructor packed the parachute
* $\P{Peter packed} \sim 0$: one is nearly certain that Peter *didn't* pack the parachute
* $\Ug{instructor packed}{jump}\gg 1$: good benefit from jumping, with instructor packing the  parachute
* $\Ug{Peter packed}{jump}\ll 0$: large cost  from jumping, with Peter packing the  parachute
* $\Ug{Peter packed}{don't jump}=\Ug{instructor packed}{don't jump}\sim 0$: neutral gain for not jumping in either case

\subsection{Analyzing the Responses}\label{sec:mcgrewresponse}

Notice, for McGrew to have "faith in his instructor", two things must be true:
1. $\P{instructor packed} \sim 1$: one is nearly certain the instructor packed the parachute
1. $\Ug{instructor packed}{jump}\gg 1$: good benefit from jumping, with instructor packing the  parachute

McGrew wants to focus on point (2), while Boghossian wants to focus on point (1). Once seen this way, it is very easy to understand the responses.

For example, why don't we say that we have faith in the existence of
chickens? Because,
\beqn
\Ug{chickens exist}{action} \sim \Ug{chickens don't exist}{action}\sim 0
\eeqn
for all actions - we have nothing at stake, there is no utility, even if  we are confident that chickens exist (i.e. $P(\mbox{chickens exist})\sim 1$).

Does McGrew have have faith or evidence that Islam is false?  McGrew claims he has evidence that Islam is false, $\Pg{Islam}{data}\ll 1$, but is not venturing anything on Islam (or more accurately, on his choice to
not follow Islam), $\Ug{not-Islam}{action}\sim 0$. Again, Boghossian sees the first part (the probabilities), yet ignores the second part (the utilities).

Going back to the exchange, we note, however, that sometimes McGrew is also using Boghossian's definition:

* Boghossian: *"what do people mean when they accuse someone of having
`faith in evolution' "*?
* McGrew: *"You're trusting in something that you cannot completely verify because it doesn't lie open to your senses."*

Now I can think of no way to understand this statement from the
perspective of McGrew's definition:
\pquote{When I act on that belief I am taking some step that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control.}

What outcomes are you placing beyond your control believing in
evolution? What obvious utility are you weighing in this case? As far as
we can see there is none, and so *faith* in this context is in fact being used here as "belief without sufficient evidence". 

\subsection{Priors and Faith}\label{priors-and-faith}

We think this brings in another aspect of faith, which we believe applies to all of the cases explored so far, and that is that faith is used only in contexts with low *prior* probability. In this conversation,
they spoke of faith in the context of the supernatural, extreme
activities (i.e. jumping out of planes), events beyond our immediate
senses - all of which coincide with lower *prior* probability, and
need *more* evidence than is typical to overcome them. They may, or
may not, also have high utility. We don't have faith in the existence of
chickens because the existence of chickens has high *prior*
probability.

Because of this, it makes sense that there are those who are not convinced by the evidence for things others have *faith* in, because of the necessary quantity and quality to bring a low *prior* probability up to a significant *posterior* probability.  For those who are convinced by the evidence, it also makes sense that they would then focus on the *utility* of the claims.  The problem that arises, however, is a problem with the word *faith*.  Since it is referring to two distinct components, the apologist can easily switch between them
without even noticing it themselves. Again, we put forward the suggestion to discuss things in terms of decision theory and avoid words with multiple meanings.  

\subsection{Without Evidence}

Although a bit shorter and punchier, the term "belief without evidence" is misleading, even if you know you are focussing on the probability side of the analysis.  The more honest phrase would be "belief without *sufficient* evidence". When people say
there is no evidence for something (like God, UFOs, astrology, psychic
phenomena, etc\ldots{}), they really mean that there is terrible
evidence for something. Even in the case of something so poorly supported as astrology, there is *some* evidence for its claims - the probability is not zero.  It may be very small, but one could imagine evidence in principle that would convince you, which means that the probability is indeed non-zero. The exaggerated, more
simple, phrase of "belief without evidence" is counterproductive,
especially when the more accurate phrase, "belief without
*sufficient* evidence", is nearly as simple.

            <Title>How to Approach Miracles</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

I listened to a
\href{http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-1/}{recent
interview}
(\href{http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-2/)}{Part
2}) with Matthew Ferguson on the
\href{http://donjohnsonministries.org/}{Don Johnson show}, which I found
pretty impressive. Matthew Ferguson has a
\href{http://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/}{very interesting blog}
that I just found, and have been enjoying reading.

\subsection{Initial Comments}\label{pandoc-initial-comments}

However, I did find several points in the informal debate that I thought
could be handled better (from my armchair, of course!). Just to note
that although I think that if I were there, I might have been able to
deal with some of the questions better, I also think that nearly all of
the debate was handled much better than I could have done. What struck
me at one point, in
\href{http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-2/)}{Part
2}, was Don's zeal for the
\href{http://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-New-Testament-Accounts/dp/0801039525}{miracles
collection by Craig Keener}
(\href{http://www.uncrediblehallq.net/2012/01/0shou5/review-of-craig-keeners-miracles/)}{review
of Keener's book here}). He seemed to think that because there were
hundreds of thousands of miracle reports, that that was evidence for
their truth. He was, however, quick to dismiss any comparison with other
pseudosciences. Ferguson admits on his blog that the ``debate came off
as a little ambushy'' on this point, because he hadn't read this book,
and clearly couldn't respond to all of them, but I think that misses the
point. I think one can address the miracle claims without being entirely
dismissive (and sounding closed minded) but putting them in their proper
context.

\subsection{Evaluating Miracle Claims - Some Lessons from
UFOs}\label{pandoc-evaluating-miracle-claims---some-lessons-from-ufos}

So in Keener's book, there is a \textbf{huge} collection of claims of
miracles. We could find an equally large collection of UFO sightings.
Now, Don and other Christians would be quick to dismiss UFO sightings as
irrelevant, but I would raise the questions:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Given a set of claims, how do we determine whether they are true?
\item
  Are any of them true?
\item
  Do the number of claims contribute to their truth value?
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

I believe that the methods we use to determine the veracity of UFO
claims can be used to investigate any claims, remarkable or not,
including miracle claims. To start, we clearly we can't personally
investigate every single claim, and thus cannot comment on ones we
haven't investigated except to note where it seems similar to ones that
we have. I have a friend who I managed (over several years) to break of
his UFO enthusiasm - he was convinced by all of these television shows
claiming evidence for alien spacecraft observations and visitations. He
invited me over to his house periodically to watch these shows to get my
reaction. This is the process that I would use:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  I would write down each specific claim - what was \emph{actually}
  being claimed, and what details were there? (names of places, time,
  who saw what, etc\ldots{})
\item
  I would note any initial inconsistencies (for example, there was once
  where, in the interview process, the different witnesses actually
  described \emph{different} things! this seemed to go unnoticed by the
  reporter)
\item
  I would go home, and try to find out as much about the \emph{original}
  details of the events. It would take me probably at least an hour for
  each case, and some I couldn't track down. However, many of them I
  could. I would read the claims again, and the skeptical accounts, and
  the responses to the skeptics. I would try to see what the actual data
  was, how it was collected, when it was reported, etc\ldots{}
\end{enumerate}

What I found for \emph{every} case that I personally investigated was
the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Most of the \emph{actual}, original claims were mundane. Lights in the
  sky, marks on the ground, etc\ldots{}. No hard evidence of anything
  remarkable.
\item
  Misinterpretation of a known object, or objects, in the sky or on the
  ground.
\item
  The reporting of the claims grew more and more remarkable. A
  particularly good example was the
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident}{Rendelsham
  Forest} UFO case where the initial reports were just lights, and the
  later reports involved spacecraft, alien code-books, etc\ldots{}
\item
  There were serious inconsistencies between reports, or anomalous
  non-reports (i.e.~people who \emph{should} have seen something but
  didn't). A good example of this was a
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_O'Hare_International_Airport_UFO_sighting}{Chicago
  airport sighting} where a small group of people, in a localized area
  of the airport, saw something yet the large number of other people in
  the nearby areas of the airport reported nothing.
\end{enumerate}

I repeat - in \emph{every single case} that I personally investigated,
these points were in evidence. Then I look through something like the
\href{http://files.ncas.org/condon/text/contents.htm}{Condon report}
where they go through something like 30 years of data in the height of
the UFO craze and don't come up with even a single item that is not
mundane in its nature. After that, new UFO claims I see with suspicion
even if I don't check them out. If something seems straightforward to
check out, I might do it, but I don't feel it is my job to investigate
every claim. If there had been even a single case which pointed to
something probably remarkable, I'd have a different attitude.

\begin{quote}
Lesson: if the claims made shrink and disappear at critical and
skeptical investigation, the claim is not likely to be true.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Miracles}\label{pandoc-miracles}

The Catholic Church has a division to investigate miracles, and has
determined that some of them are genuine. However, the Catholic Church
often has significant blinders, and definitely takes a long time to
adjust to obvious mistakes (Galileo anyone?).

Take, for example,
\href{http://listverse.com/2008/07/14/top-10-astonishing-miracles/}{this
site on top 10 miracles}. I've personally researched about 3 or 4 of
these, and it is quite clear that those are definitely frauds (\#1, 2,
3, and 5 I've checked). Yet, do we get any retraction from the Catholic
Church? Do we get \emph{any} hint of skepticism? None at all.

Again, I follow the same steps as above. I do not take someone else's
word, necessarily, and I don't discount them out of hand. The miracles
of Fatima are a great example. First, we have ``visions'' from highly
impressionable children, one of whom was known to have made up fanciful
stories in the recent past. These children are the only ones who ``see''
it, until the last vision where hundreds claimed to see the ``Miracle of
the Sun''. The problem? The initial stories did not agree, and we only
get a semi-consistent story after the various witnesses spoke with each
other and to a priest collecting the reports. Check out
\href{http://www.csicop.org/si/show/real_secrets_of_fatima/}{The Real
Secrets of Fatima} for the details. All of the elements spoken about
above can be seen - initial mundane experiences, misinterpretation of
known objects (i.e.~the sun, and clouds), the exaggeration of stories in
later recollection, serious inconsistencies in reports and notable
non-reports.

The same goes for every faith-healer I've read about. A little digging,
and a little skepticism, and the entire enterprise come crashing down.
Many times it doesn't take much digging!

\begin{quote}
If the truth is there, then it shouldn't retreat under investigation.
\end{quote}

This is not a matter of being \emph{too skeptical}. It is a matter of
not being credulous.

            <Title>Rollercoasters: Faith in Everyday Life</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Words have meaning, and if we are going to communicate with each other
we need to make sure to use words as carefully as we can.  Otherwise,
misunderstandings abound.  It seems very common that a word like
"faith" is used by different people for different ends, and the
definition shifts even within an argument.  Take for example, the video by Rich Spear[@Spear:2013aa].  In it, Spear presents a distinction drawn between "faith" and "belief", using an analogy of a roller-coaster - belief in the ride being safe vs trusting it being safe enough to ride on.  Notice that his focus is on trust, and thus on *action*.  

It is clear that one must *at least* believe the ride is safe as a prerequisite for trusting it. Since when we say we believe *strongly* in a proposition $A$ when $P(A)&gt;0.95$ (or some other, somewhat arbitrary, high number), we can map this prerequisite to something like the following
\beqn
\P{safe} = 0.99 \\
\P{unsafe} = 0.01
\eeqn

Once you believe it is safe, do you trust it to ride?  This brings in decision theory, where we mix probabilities with utility measures. You could believe it to be safe at the $\P{safe} = 0.99$ level, but still not trust it "with your life" because of the *cost* associated with being wrong.  A utility table might look like

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Utility (benefits and costs)}}  \\ \midrule
 &amp; \textit{safe} &amp; \textit{unsafe}\\
\textit{ride} &amp; 10 &amp; -1000   \\
\textit{don't ride} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.1in}

Calculating the average utility for each action we get
\beqn
\langle U_{\mbox{ride}}\rangle &amp;=&amp; 0.99 \times 10 + 0.01\times (-1000) = -0.1 \\
\langle U_{\mbox{don't ride}}\rangle &amp;=&amp; 0.99 \times 0 + 0.01\times 0 = 0 
\eeqn
so it is better not to ride.

As a result, *trust* requires both belief and a sufficiently positive net utility. Placed in these terms it is much more clear how the argument is set up.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  when the Spear says that "faith" is like "trust", he is
  already approaching the problem with strong belief, and is assessing
  utility - and he rightly claims that belief is not enough.
\item
  when the atheists say that "faith" is "belief without evidence",
  they are addressing the strength of the evidence to obtain strong
  belief in the first place - and claiming that the evidence is not sufficient.
\item
  when the Spear and others say that "faith is rational" they are either talking about utility, not belief, or they are claiming that the
  evidence is in fact good enough for strong belief, and then
  consequently high utility.
\end{itemize}

In all cases, it seems as if for the religious, utility and belief are
muddled when using the word "faith".  For the atheist, "faith" is
always first and foremost about belief, because even the usage involving trust has belief as a prerequisite.  Perhaps if we frame the problem in terms of belief (probability) and utility we can clear up the fog surrounding discussions of the term *faith*.

            <Title>Faith: A Matter of Definitions</Title>
            <Text># &lt;$Title&gt;


The word *faith* has many definitions, some which seem conflicting.  However, as it is commonly used, the definitions point to a single quantity.  It is easiest to see this in the exploration of faith from specific examples.

</Text>
        </Document>
        <Document ID="45">
            <Title>Introduction to Faith and Probability</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

It may be helpful to start with the dictionary definition, and then follow with a number of statements about *faith* to see where the common usages fall.
    
* faith (noun)[@MerriamWebster2009]
    * strong belief or trust in someone or something
    * belief in the existence of God
    * strong religious feelings or beliefs
    * a system of religious beliefs
* Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. [^Hebrews 11:1, New International Version]
* Faith is trusting in, holding to, and acting on what one has
good reason to believe is true in the face of difficulties. The
difficulties may be where you have to take an action where the outcome
is beyond your control. (Tim McGrew)[Brierley:2014aa]
* Belief without evidence.  Pretending to know things you do not know. (Peter Boghossian)[@Brierley:2014aa]
* One of the things that becomes apparent in serious Christian literature is that no one uses 'faith' in the sense of *believing things without reasons*. That might be Richard Dawkins' preferred definition - except when he was publicly asked by Oxford's Professor John Lennox whether he had 'faith' in his lovely wife - but it is important to know that in theology 'faith' always means *personal trust* in the God whose existence one accepts on other grounds. I think God is real for philosophical, historical, and experiential reasons. Only on the basis of my reasoned conviction can I then *trust* God - have faith in him - in the sense meant in theology.[http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-18/dickson-tips-for-atheists/5397892][empasis in original]
* Faith is the excuse people give when they believe something and don't have a good reason. When you believe something and have a good reason, then you give the reason. And in every other instance, you offer something that is faith. - Matt Dillahunty

From these few definitions, we can already see a few things.  First, people use the term in different ways, at different times, so it will be critical that we tack down a particular definition.  It is also critical to recognize which definition someone is using, so we don't inadvertently straw-man their argument.  Second, the two primary components that seem to make up all definitions of faith are *belief* and *trust*.  Faith seems to not be a synonym of either, but a particular combination of them with some restrictions - not all beliefs or acts of trust require faith.

\subsection{Belief, Trust, and Faith}

We have already seen that *belief* is represented mathematically by *probability*, so where *faith* requires belief we will employ probabilities.  *Trust*[@MerriamWebster2009] is "belief that someone or something is reliable, good, honest, effective, etc." So it would seem that trust is a subset of belief, like knowledge is a subset, pertaining specifically to the reliability or goodness of the thing believed. 

Faith, however, seems to go a bit further than trust and involve *action* or the willingness to act.  When asked by Peter Boghossian, *"why don't we say that we have faith in the existence of chickens?"*, Tim McGrew replies, 
\pquote{We are venturing nothing on the existence of chickens. When I believe
that chickens exist and I act on that belief I am not taking any step
that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control. [In the
case of religion], people are placing the outcome of their eternal
soul out of their control. They are taking a risk where the outcomes
matter. The decision itself is evidenced but the outcome is
uncertain.}

\subsection{Utility - Probability and Action}

Probability relates to belief, a measure of state of knowledge about a claim or set of claims.  We can use the mathematics of probability to determine the most likely claim, and use it to inform our actions, but it isn't enough to truly determine the best course of action.  For that, we need to extend the mathematics to include the notion of *utility*, an extension commonly referred to as *decision theory*.  Because faith seems to involve action or potential actions, it to will need to be formulated in this way.  

Decision theory uses the idea of expected value to aid in making decisions, defined as[@Wikipedia:2015aa]
\begin{quote}
The idea of expected value is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all
possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the
probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply
the two to give an expected value. The action to be chosen should be the
one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.
\end{quote}

The utility values, costs and benefits, could be written in monetary terms, but need not.  One needs only to have a scale to represent how good or bad an outcome is.  The total expected value, also called the  average utility, is just the sum of the individual costs and benefits associated with possible outcomes, weighted by their probability - more likely outcomes are weighted more than less likely ones.  An example will help.

The example here is called the "farmer's dilemma”[@jordaan2005decisions], concerns a farmer who can plant one of three crops (labeled $A, B, $ and $C$) with the possibility of three different environments out of the farmer's control, *perfect weather*, *fair weather*, and *bad weather*.  Each of the three crops fare differently in different weather, and thus provide different costs and benefits to the farmer depending on the environment.  Crop $A$, for example, does very well in good weather but very badly in bad, whereas crop $C$ doesn't do as well but is more consistent, with crop $B$ in between.  This can be summarized by the following table of utilities showing benefits (positive) and costs (negative) for each possible combination:

\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
 &amp; \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Utility (benefits and costs)}}   \\ \midrule
 &amp; \textit{perfect weather} &amp; \textit{fair weather} &amp; \textit{bad weather}   \\
\textit{plant crop $A$} &amp; 11 &amp; 1 &amp; -3  \\
\textit{plant crop $B$} &amp; 7 &amp; 5 &amp; 0  \\
\textit{plant crop $C$} &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 2   \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.1in}

Any decision the farmer makes must include the probabilities (his state of knowledge) of the weather environments.  At the extremes, it is easy to see this.  If perfect weather is nearly guaranteed, for example, then planting crop $A$ is of course the best option, whereas if bad weather is guaranteed, then planting crop $C$ is the best.  How does one handle the decision away from the extremes?  This is done by asking, what is the average utility (benefit or cost) for each action, and then choosing the action which maximizes this.  Imagine that the farmer consults a meteorologist, and they determine the following probabilities for the weather environment[^It is possible in some cases that the environmental state also depends on the actions taken.  This is easy to add to this framework, but makes this particular example needlessly complex.]
\beqn
\P{perfect weather}&amp;=&amp;0.1 \\
\P{fair weather}&amp;=&amp;0.5 \\
\P{bad weather}&amp;=&amp;0.4 \\
\eeqn

The average utility[^Average, or expected, value of a variable $U$ is denoted with angle brackets, $\langle U \rangle$] for each action is simply the sum of the probabilities of each environment times the utility for that environment given the action, such as
\beqn
\langle U_A \rangle &amp;=&amp; \P{perfect weather}\times {\rm U}(\mbox{perfect weather}|\mbox{plant crop $A$}) + \\
&amp;&amp; \P{fair weather}\times {\rm U}(\mbox{fair weather}|\mbox{plant crop $A$}) + \\
&amp;&amp; \P{fair weather}\times {\rm U}(\mbox{bad weather}|\mbox{plant crop $A$}) \\
&amp;=&amp; 0.1 \times 11 + 0.5 \times 1 + 0.4\times (-3) = 0.4
\eeqn
Performing the same calculation for all of the actions yields,
\beqn
\langle U_A \rangle &amp;=&amp; 0.1 \times 11 + 0.5 \times 1 + 0.4\times (-3) = 0.4 \\
\langle U_B \rangle &amp;=&amp; 0.1 \times 7 + 0.5 \times 5 + 0.4\times 0 = 3.2 \\
\langle U_C \rangle &amp;=&amp; 0.1 \times 2 + 0.5 \times 2 + 0.4\times 2 = 2.0
\eeqn

and the best action would be planting crop $B$, because it has the highest expected utility.

The primary point about this process that is relevant to our discussion of faith is that the process involves two separate entities - the probability of various states and the value those states are to us given our actions.  This maps directly to the concepts of *belief* and *trust*, respectively.  One can focus on each one individually, but it is the combination that is important.  

Although there are cases where the average utility is a bad guide, it is a very useful framework to structure a problem.  It should be noted that *utility* does not need to be restricted to money, but can include things like comfort and discomfort.  For example, someone could be *risk averse*, which means that they put a utility on some psychological comfort at the expense of some monetary loss.  Thus the utility value would combine both.

            <Title>A More Formal Exploration</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

In the philosophical literature, there are more formal explorations of these concepts.  These explorations can be helped by casting the ideas into the probabilistic framework.  For example, Daniel Howard-Snyder considers what he calls "Propositional Faith”[@howard2013propositional].  He immediately recognizes, as we do here, that the word *faith* has many usages which he clears away as being not on topic, and focuses on the use of faith in a sentence like *"A wife might have faith that her marriage will survive a crisis"* or *"Frances has faith that her young songs will live long and fulfilling lives."*  Each of these cases has the sentence structure of "$A$ has *faith that* $B$".  In his clearing of other uses, Howard-Snyder removes the following usages,
* Faith as a noun (e.g. "earnestly content for *the faith*")
* Faith as a process (e.g. the process of coming to believe the Gospel as a result of the Holy Spirit)
* Taking something *on faith* (i.e. taking on authority or testimony)
* Faith as assent to a proposition with certainty
* Faith as a kind of knowledge

It is interesting to see what Howard-Snyder considers propositional faith, and some of the considerations around it.  We believe he is still using the term inconsistently, in two ways - one which matches the structure we've been exploring in this book, and the other as a direct synonym for *hope*.  Consider the following case from his paper.
\pquote{Propositional faith does not require `certainty', without any hesitation or hanging back.  A wife might have faith that her marriage will survive a crisis, while harboring doubts about it.  Indeed, propositional faith is precisely that attitude in virtue of which she might possess the inner stability and impetus that enables her to contribute to the realization of that state of affairs, despite her lack of certainty.}

This case matches decision theory quite nicely. The equations are:
\beqn
\langle U_{\mbox{action}}\rangle &amp;=&amp; \Pg{successful marriage}{action}\times \Ug{successful marriage}{action} + \\
&amp;&amp; \Pg{failed marriage}{action}\times \Ug{failed marriage}{action} \\
\langle U_{\mbox{inaction}}\rangle &amp;=&amp; \Pg{successful marriage}{inaction}\times \Ug{successful marriage}{inaction} + \\
&amp;&amp; \Pg{failed marriage}{inaction}\times \Ug{failed marriage}{inaction}
\eeqn
where the probabilities of the outcomes, as well as the utilities, clearly change with the the possible actions.  For example, we expect action to have a positive effect on the probability of a successful marriage, $\Pg{successful marriage}{action}&gt;\Pg{successful marriage}{inaction}$.


A possible utility table, which reflects the idea that, if the marriage is successful without action then there was time and resources saved, but if the marriage failed without action there is a penalty in the form of guilt over lost opportunity.  Obviously there are many complications that this table overlooks, and should be seen as a basic approximation.

\vspace{.1in}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Utility (benefits and costs)}}  \\ \midrule
 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{*How is the marriage?*}  \\ 
  &amp; \textit{successful marriage} &amp; \textit{failed marriage}\\
\textit{action}  &amp; 90 &amp; -100   \\
\textit{inaction} &amp;100 &amp; -110  \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.1in}

 The high positive utility that the wife puts on her successful marriage, and high negative utility to its failure, directs her to make actions in her marriage's favor despite having lower probability of its success.  This is the notion of *faith* worked out.

Another case is
\pquote{But one can have faith that something is thus-and-so without entrusting one's welfare to it in any way, as when I have faith that Emily will survive breast cancer but I do not entrust my well-being to her or her survival}
where as far as we can see, the use of *faith* here is completely indistinguishable from *hope*.  There is no utility explicit in the statement, and the probability is presumed to be low.

            <Title>The Basic Rules of Probability</Title>
            <Text>###  &lt;$Title&gt;

For a complete description of these rules, and their application in general statistical inference there are several books available, one of which from the present author[@Blais:2014aa].  We will need to establish a basic set of notation and mathematics in order to address the concepts.  This notation will in some cases make clear and condensed (due the terseness of mathematics) much longer expositions of the same concepts in English.  In other cases it will provide a systematic framework for exploring disparate problems, in order to see the connection to all of rational thought.  We begin by describing the rules of probability, and some of their consequences.

            <Title>Pascal's Wager</Title>
            <Text>## &lt;$Title&gt;

Blaise Pascal, a French philosopher, put forward an argument referred to now as ``Pascal's Wager’’[@Wikipedia:2015ac] for the religious life .  The argument is based on decision theory, and is one of the first uses of this theory on any topic.  In the ``Wager'', Pascal states that people choose to believe or not believe in God, and the possible environments they find themselves in are the God either exists or doesn't.  He then sets up the utility table,

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Utility (benefits and costs)}}  \\ \midrule
 &amp; \textit{God Exists} &amp; \textit{God Does Not Exist}\\
\textit{Believe in God} &amp; $+\infty$ (infinite gain) &amp; -1 (finite loss)   \\
\textit{Don't Believe in God} &amp; $-\infty$ (infinite loss) &amp; +1 (finite gain) \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.1in}

It is clear then that the best course of action, given this utility table, is to believe.  There are many problems with this argument, some which impact the mathematics and others that are theological.  An example of the former is the analysis assumes only one possible God - what if you choose the wrong God?  Extending the table to include this would make the ``best choice'' not as clear cut.  An example of the latter is the idea that one cannot simple {\em choose} to believe, and the act of pretending to believe would go against the dictates of God.  

Pascal's Wager is, however, a useful starting point for a discussion and highlights some of the issues one faces when applying decision theory too simplistically.

            <Title>List of Lessons</Title>
            <Text>The mathematics of probability theory is the gold standard for all statistical inference.  It structures all inference in a systematic fashion.  However, it can be used without doing any calculations, as a guide to qualitative inference.  Some of the lessons that are consequences of probability theory are listed here, and will be noted throughout this text in various examples.

* Confidence in a claim should scale with the evidence for that claim - the more evidence the higher confidence.
* Ockham's razor, which is the philosophical idea that simpler theories are preferred, is a consequence of Bayes' Rule when comparing models of differing complexity that explain the data equally.
* A complex model must explain the data *better* than a simple model to be preferred.
* Simpler means fewer adjustable parameters.
* Simpler also means that the predictions are both *specific* and not *overly plastic*. For example, a hypothesis that is consistent with the observed data, and can also be consistent if the data were the opposite, would be overly plastic.
* Your inference is only as good as the hypotheses (i.e. models) that you consider.
* Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.[@sagandemon]
* It is better to explicitly display your assumptions rather than implicitly hold them.
* It is a *good thing* to update your beliefs when you receive new information.
* Not all uncertainties are the same.
