For a complete description of these rules, and their application in general statistical inference there are several books available, one of which from the present author[@Blais:2014aa].  We will need to establish a basic set of notation and mathematics in order to address the concepts.  This notation will in some cases make clear and condensed (due the terseness of mathematics) much longer expositions of the same concepts in English.  In other cases it will provide a systematic framework for exploring disparate problems, in order to see the connection to all of rational thought.  We begin by describing the rules of probability, and some of their consequences.\
