Richard Swinburne has written[@swinburne2004existence][@swinburne2003resurrection] that a thorough probabilistic approach leads one to the conclusion that the resurrection is at least 97% likely. The calculation is definitely flawed, but how?  In order to explore this, we need to outline the actual argument.  This is a good example of obfuscation with probabilistic mathemetics.\
