\f0\fs28 \cf0 There are some dangers in this approach.  Most notably there is the danger of introducing confusion by hiding incorrect reasoning behind a smoke-screen of mathematics.  For many, even seeing equations is something scary and they see any presentation with mathematics as being more likely to be true.  The thinking goes, \'93this is technical, the person presenting it must be smart, so it is more likely true.\'94  However it is just as likely to be the case that the person presenting the math is just smart at hiding poor reasoning, and that can be done with mathematics more easily.\

It is my intent in this book to give you the tools to recreate the claims anyone uses, so that you can confirm for yourself whether something is being hidden in the analysis.  It is also my intent to provide a framework to convert vague philosophical language into the concrete language of probabilities, which leads to a much more powerful method of examining the philosophy.}
