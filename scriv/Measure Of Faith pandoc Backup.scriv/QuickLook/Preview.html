<p class="binderItem"><strong>Why write a book like this?</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
This book is written to address the role that the mathematics of probability can play when applied to topics in religion.  Specifically, we have found that there are two primary purposes of this approach:<br/>
<br/>
1. Bring clarity to other similar treatments of these topics.  The mathematics of probability have, unfortunately, been used to give the veneer of authority and objectivity to Christian apologetic arguments that are not well supported[@swinburne2003resurrection].  This is typicall...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Who is this for?</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
Although we intend this book to be technical, we do not want to scare away those who are less mathematical.  In fact, we would consider it a success if someone who is not particularly inclined in the mathematical arts would be able to get a new appreciation for these topics upon reading this book.  Therefore, we will try to limit the technical aspects to those that are only absolutely necessary, and will rely heavily on specific examples at all times.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Organization</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
In this chapter we outline the basics of probability, applied to a few simple cases.  We then explore in subsequent chapters the details of specific concepts, including *faith*, *miracles*, and *historical methods*.  Typically, these explorations center around responses to particular works, podcast discussions and debates.  </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction to Probability</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
When we speak about probability, we speak about a percentage chance (0%-100%) for something to happen, although we often write the percentage as a decimal number, between 0 and 1.  If the  probability of an event is 0 then it is the same as saying that you are certain that the event will never happen.  If the probability is 1 then *you are certain that it will happen*.  Life is full of uncertainty, so we assign a number somewhere between 0 and 1 to describe our state of knowledge of...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Basic Rules of Probability</strong><br/>###  <$Title><br/>
<br/>
For a complete description of these rules, and their application in general statistical inference there are several books available, one of which from the present author[@Blais:2014aa].  We will need to establish a basic set of notation and mathematics in order to address the concepts.  This notation will in some cases make clear and condensed (due the terseness of mathematics) much longer expositions of the same concepts in English.  In other cases it will provide a systematic fr...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rule 1 (Definition rule)</strong><br/>#### Rule 1 (Definition rule):<br/>
<br/>
$P(A)$ is a number between 0 and 1, representing the strength of belief in a statement, $A$.<br/>
<br/>
An example is  $$P(\mbox{you will get struck by lightning sometime in your life}) = 0.0002$$<br/>
<br/>
Although this probability is estimated by the fraction of people being struck by lightning, whenever we write probabilities we are referring to a measure of the strength of one's belief in a proposition.  Thus, this probability means that you believe it to be extremely unlikely t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rule 2 (Negation rule)</strong><br/>#### Rule 2 (Negation rule):<br/>
<br/>
$$P(A) + P({\rm\bf not}\, A) = 1$$<br/>
In other words, either a statement is true or its negation is true.<br/>

which is the probability of two statements both being true, A **and** B.  We define a new symbol, $|$, which should be read as ``given.''  When there is information given, we call this probability *conditional* on that information. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Defining Terms</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
Clearly the terms simplicity, belief, knowledge, and proof are related but it is the framework of probability that helps us be specific about their differences.  We can summarize the situation with the following,<br/>
<br/>
* *Simplicity* refers to the flexibility of a model or hypothesis.  The *simpler* one is less flexible.<br/>
* *Belief* is measured by probability.  Higher probability is equivalent to stronger belief, and likewise, lower probability is equivalent to weaker belief.<br/>
* *Knowledge...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Simplicity</strong><br/>### <$Title><br/>
<br/>
Ockham's razor, which is the philosophical idea that simpler theories are preferred, is a consequence of Bayes' rule when comparing models of differing complexity[@jefferys1991sharpening].  We can see this by extending the card game example with a fifth possibility.  Instead of giving the specific cards in this deck, we are simply told<br/>

What is knowledge?  Plato gave the following definition of knowledge:<br/>

<br/>
This is an unsatisfying definition because, it seems, in<br/>
order to justifiably label anything as *knowledge* with this<br/>
definition we'd need to be able to independently determine that the<br/>
proposition is true. This presupposes that there is some “outside”<br/>

justification at the outset.  We believe ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Proof</strong><br/>### <$Title><br/>
<br/>
### Proof<br/>
<br/>
Do *proof* and *evidence* mean the same thing?  No, they don't. To summarize, proof refers specifically to the result of a *deductive* process.  In this process, one starts with some (given) axioms, and can demonstrate *with certainty* (i.e. prove) a number of theorems (i.e direct consequences) from those axioms.  Thus, the word proof should only be used in situations involving *certainty*, or in other words, probabilities of exactly 1 or exactly 0 only.<br/>

Most notably there is the danger of introducing confusion by hiding incorrect reasoning behind a smoke-screen of mathematics.

The definition of personal revelation is the idea that God speaks directly to an individual, who then communicates their message to others.  Unfortunately, there is never any way to confirm personal revelation, so can it be used as evidence for God?  yes, but not very good evidence.  This is due to the combination of two things:<br/>

<br/>
Richard Swinburne has written[@swinburne2004existence][@swinburne2003resurrection] that a thorough probabilistic approach leads one to the conclusion that the resurrection is at least 97% likely. The calculation is definitely flawed, but how?  In order to explore this, we need to outline the actual argument.  This is a good example of obfuscation with probabilistic mathemetics.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Swinburne's argument</strong><br/> His argument is summarized here.  He defines a number of propositions, the chapter references are to his book [@swinburne2003resurrection].<br/>
<br/>
* $t$: theism is true - there is a God (of the traditional kind)<br/>
* $k$: background knowledge of natural theology<br/>
* $P(t|k)$: probability there is a God (of the traditional kind) given the background knowledge of natural theology.  He suggests (from Chapter 1) a ``modest'' value of $P(t|k) = 1/2$.  We’ll return to this later.<br/>
* $c$: the claim God became inc...</p>

### What is wrong here?<br/>
<br/>
This all looks very impressive, but what is wrong with this calculation?  It is easiest to see this with an alternative calculation.  <br/>

Dan Barker has written an Easter Challenge[@Barker:1992aa] for<br/>
any Christian to come up with a seamless account of what happened on the<br/>
day of the Resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
\pquote{The conditions of the challenge are simple and reasonable. In each of<br/>
the four Gospels, begin at Easter morning and read to the end of the<br/>
book: Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and John 20-21. Also read Acts<br/>
1:3-12 and Paul's tiny version of the story in I Corinthians 15:3-8.<br/>
