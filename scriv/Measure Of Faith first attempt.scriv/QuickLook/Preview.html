<p class="binderItem"><strong>Why write a book like this?</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
This book is written to address the role that the mathematics of probability can play when applied to topics in religion.  Specifically, we have found that there are two primary purposes of this approach:<br/>
<br/>
1. Bring clarity to other similar treatments of these topics.  The mathematics of probability have, unfortunately, been used to give the veneer of authority and objectivity to Christian apologetic arguments that are not well supported[#swinburne2003resurrection].  This is typicall...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Who is this for?</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
Although we intend this book to be technical, we do not want to scare away those who are less mathematical.  In fact, we would consider it a success if someone who is not particularly inclined in the mathematical arts would be able to get a new appreciation for these topics upon reading this book.  Therefore, we will try to limit the technical aspects to those that are only absolutely necessary, and will rely heavily on specific examples at all times.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Organization</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
In this chapter we outline the basics of probability, applied to a few simple cases.  We then explore in subsequent chapters the details of specific concepts, including *faith*, *miracles*, and *historical methods*.  Typically, these explorations center around responses to particular works, podcast discussions and debates.  </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction to Probability</strong><br/>## <$Title><br/>
<br/>
When we speak about probability, we speak about a percentage chance (0%-100%) for something to happen, although we often write the percentage as a decimal number, between 0 and 1.  If the  probability of an event is 0 then it is the same as saying that you are certain that the event will never happen.  If the probability is 1 then {\em you are certain that it will happen}.  Life is full of uncertainty, so we assign a number somewhere between 0 and 1 to describe our state of knowledg...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Basic Rules of Probability</strong><br/>###  <$Title><br/>
<br/>
For a complete description of these rules, and their application in general statistical inference there are several books available, one of which from the present author[#Blais:2014aa].  We will need to establish a basic set of notation and mathematics in order to address the concepts.  This notation will in some cases make clear and condensed (due the terseness of mathematics) much longer expositions of the same concepts in English.  In other cases it will provide a systematic fr...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rule 1 (Definition rule)</strong><br/>#### Rule 1 (Definition rule):<br/>
<br/>
$P(A)$ is a number between 0 and 1, representing the strength of belief in a statement, $A$.<br/>
<br/>
An example is  $$P(\mbox{you will get struck by lightning sometime in your life}) = 0.0002$$<br/>
<br/>
Although this probability is estimated by the fraction of people being struck by lightning, whenever we write probabilities we are referring to a measure of the strength of one's belief in a proposition.  Thus, this probability means that you believe it to be extremely unlikely t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rule 2 (Negation rule)</strong><br/>#### Rule 2 (Negation rule):<br/>
<br/>
$$P(A) + P({\rm\bf not}\, A) = 1$$<br/>
In other words, either a statement is true or its negation is true.<br/>

Ockham's razor, which is the philosophical idea that simpler theories are preferred, is a consequence of Bayes' rule when comparing models of differing complexity[#jefferys1991sharpening].  We can see this by extending the card game example with a fifth possibility.  Instead of giving the specific cards in this deck, we are simply told<br/>

<br/>
Clearly the terms belief, knowledge, and proof are related but it is the framework of probability that helps us be specific about their differences.  We can summarize the situation with the following,<br/>
<br/>
* *Belief* is measured by probability.  Higher probability is equivalent to stronger belief, and likewise, lower probability is equivalent to weaker belief.<br/>
* *Knowledge* is a subset of belief, described more specifically below.<br/>
* *Proof* refers specifically to the result of a *deduct...</p>

The mathematics of probability theory is the gold standard for all statistical inference.  It structures all inference in a systematic fashion.  However, it can be used without doing any calculations, as a guide to qualitative inference.  Some of the lessons that are consequences of probability theory are listed here, and will be noted throughout this text in various examples.<br/>

There is a danger of using mathematics to give the<br/>

The definition of personal revelation is the idea that God speaks directly to an individual, who then communicates their message to others.  Unfortunately, there is never any way to confirm personal revelation, so can it be used as evidence for God?  yes, but not very good evidence.  This is due to the combination of two things:<br/>

For example, Normal Geisler misquotes Hume\cite{Brierley:2008ab}, attributing the statement ``The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the rare.'' to Hume.
