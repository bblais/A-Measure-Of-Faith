<p class="itemText">## <$Title></p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">This book is written to address the role that the mathematics of probability can play when applied to topics in religion.  Specifically, we have found that there are two primary purposes of this approach:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">1. Bring clarity to other similar treatments of these topics.  The mathematics of probability have, unfortunately, been used to give the veneer of authority and objectivity to Christian apologetic arguments that are not well supported[@swinburne2003resurrection].  This is typicall...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Who is this for?</p>
<p class="itemText">## <$Title></p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Although we intend this book to be technical, we do not want to scare away those who are less mathematical.  In fact, we would consider it a success if someone who is not particularly inclined in the mathematical arts would be able to get a new appreciation for these topics upon reading this book.  Therefore, we will try to limit the technical aspects to those that are only absolutely necessary, and will rely heavily on specific examples at all times.</p>

<p class="itemText">## <$Title></p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">In this chapter we outline the basics of probability, applied to a few simple cases.  We then explore in subsequent chapters the details of specific concepts, including *faith*, *miracles*, and *historical methods*.  Typically, these explorations center around responses to particular works, podcast discussions and debates.  </p>

<p class="itemTitle">Introduction to Probability</p>
<p class="itemText">## <$Title></p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">When we speak about probability, we speak about a percentage chance (0%-100%) for something to happen, although we often write the percentage as a decimal number, between 0 and 1.  If the  probability of an event is 0 then it is the same as saying that you are certain that the event will never happen.  If the probability is 1 then *you are certain that it will happen*.  Life is full of uncertainty, so we assign a number somewhere between 0 and 1 to describe our state of knowledge of...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">For a complete description of these rules, and their application in general statistical inference there are several books available, one of which from the present author[@Blais:2014aa].  We will need to establish a basic set of notation and mathematics in order to address the concepts.  This notation will in some cases make clear and condensed (due the terseness of mathematics) much longer expositions of the same concepts in English.  In other cases it will provide a systematic fr...</p>

<p class="itemText">* *Simplicity* refers to the flexibility of a model or hypothesis.  The *simpler* one is less flexible.</p>

<p class="itemText">Ockham's razor, which is the philosophical idea that simpler theories are preferred, is a consequence of Bayes' rule when comparing models of differing complexity[@jefferys1991sharpening].

<p class="itemText">Do *proof* and *evidence* mean the same thing?  No, they don't. To summarize, proof refers specifically to the result of a *deductive* process.  In this process, one starts with some (given) axioms, and can demonstrate *with certainty* (i.e. prove) a number of theorems (i.e direct consequences) from those axioms.  Thus, the word proof should only be used in situations involving *certainty*, or in other words, probabilities of exactly 1 or exactly 0 only.</p>

Some of the lessons that are consequences of probability theory are listed here, and will be noted throughout this text in various examples.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Some Dangers</p>
<p class="itemText">There are some dangers in this approach.  Most notably there is the danger of introducing confusion by hiding incorrect reasoning behind a smoke-screen of mathematics.  For many, even seeing equations is something scary and they see any presentation with mathematics as being more likely to be true.  The thinking goes, “this is technical, the person presenting it must be smart, so it is more likely true.”  However it is just as likely to be the case that the person presenting the math is just sma...</p>

<p class="itemText">The word *faith* has many definitions, some which seem conflicting.  However, as it is commonly used, the definitions point to a single quantity.  It is easiest to see this in the exploration of faith from specific examples.</p>

The argument is based on decision theory, and is one of the first uses of this theory on any topic.  In the ``Wager'', Pascal states that people choose to believe or not believe in God, and the possible environments they find themselves in are the God either exists or doesn't.  He then sets up the utility table,</p>

<p class="itemText">In the philosophical literature, there are more formal explorations of these concepts.  These explorations can be helped by casting the ideas into the probabilistic framework.  For example, Daniel Howard-Snyder considers what he calls "Propositional Faith”[@howard2013propositional].  He immediately recognizes, as we do here, that the word *faith* has many usages which he clears away as being not on topic, and focuses on the use of faith in a sentence like *"A wife might have faith t...</p>

<p class="itemText">Perhaps the most influential work on miracles is the chapter ``Of Miracles'' in David Hume's larger work on reason[@Hume:1748aa].  It is also one of the most often \emph{misquoted} books as well.  For example, Normal Geisler misquotes Hume[@Brierley:2008ab], attributing the statement ``The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the rare.'' to Hume.
