Although we intend this book to be technical, we do not want to scare away those who are less mathematical.  In fact, we would consider it a success if someone who is not particularly inclined in the mathematical arts would be able to get a new appreciation for these topics upon reading this book.  Therefore, we will try to limit the technical aspects to those that are only absolutely necessary, and will rely heavily on specific examples at all times.\
